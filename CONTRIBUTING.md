All of our contributions flow through GitHub.

## Write an article

Interested in writing an article for Perl.com? Perhaps you want to get the word out about your new startup, provide a tutorial on your favorite module, or have community news to share. This document is for you.

You can propose an article as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues), or simply send up a pull request. Inside the repo, you can run the `make new` target and you'll be led through the questions to set up your initial article template:

	% make new

You can then check your article by starting a local server (using [Hugo 0.59](https://gohugo.io/news/0.59.0-relnotes/) and no other version):

	% make start

Once you submit your article, an editor will help guide it to its final form.

Don't know what to write about? See our [article](https://perldotcom.perl.org/article/how-to-find-a-programming-topic-to-write-about/) on how to find a topic.

Check out our first time author [tutorial](https://perldotcom.perl.org/article/how-to-write-your-first-article-for-perl-com/) to understand our contributor process.  Our [Style Guide](STYLE-GUIDE.md) describes our standards and has tips to make your articles better. For the most part, your article should look and read like other Perl.com articles.

## Fix a problem

Since we've moved to GitHub, it's easy for you to fix problems you find, whether that's a simple typo to adjusting code for new interfaces.

You can edit files directly in GitHub, which will automatically fork our repo and send a pull request.

For big edits, you might want to raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues) before you spend too much time on it.
