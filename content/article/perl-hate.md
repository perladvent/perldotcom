*Perl certainly picks up its fair share of criticism. We've collected of some of the best (worst?) Perl jokes / critiques, as what's the point of laughing if you can't laugh at yourself?*

### Generic ire

Perl has an uncanny ability to inspire negative feelings in all kinds of people, from programming luminaries like [L Peter Deutsch](http://books.google.com/books?id=nneBa6-mWfgC&pg=PA442&lpg=PA442&dq=perl+is+an+abomination+deutsch&source=bl&ots=gEAvJbIW1u&sig=0X7y2z1MgF8i2bjeSeQAcSFn7Pk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HvJBU6SLJOSvsQTytYDICg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=perl%20is%20an%20abomination%20deutsch&f=false):

> Perl is an abomination as a language

Or famous coder blogger [Steve Yegge](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/seajure/GLqhj_2915A):

> Perl. How else did such a crappy language become such a dominant force?

To rank-and-file programmers' thoughtful [rants](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/8/2/184130/6279):

> What IDIOT invented this stupid language? Why would anybody waste their time with this IDIOTIC SHIT when there are perfectly good languages like C out there?

Or producing creative artworks:

### Aesthetically speaking

If there is one aspect of Perl that generates hate like no other, it's how it looks (those shallow coders!). It's [received wisdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language%0A) that Perl is a "write-only" language, such as this gem from [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/pypar.html):

> At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl

Criticisms often allude to illegibility:

[![](http://perl-begin.org/humour/Sm2na25.jpg)](http://perl-begin.org/humour/Sm2na25.jpg)

Or more crudely:

[![](http://memecrunch.com/meme/2CZJN/perl-wtf-is-this-shit/image.png)](http://memecrunch.com/meme/2CZJN/perl-wtf-is-this-shit/image.png)

Or Keith Bostic's [famous claim](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/437174-perl-the-only-language-that-looks-the-same-before):

> Perl – The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.

Uncyclopedia has a hilarious [Perl entry](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Perl), which mostly pokes fun at Perl's legibility. Perl isn't just unreadable. It's [ugly](http://www.dmclaughlin.com/2009/04/19/ugly-perl-a-lesson-in-the-importance-of-api-design/), [dirty](http://kalyanchakravarthy.net/?p=115) and even [hairy](http://everything2.com/title/I+hate+Perl).

### Perl 6

Of course Perl 6 has not escaped the criticism. There is some creative Perl 6 art out there. Like these [fake O'Reilly covers](http://hbfs.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/the-perl-6-logo/):

### On mortality

This is a common meme. You don't go from being the number 1 web programming language to say, top 5 without picking up some Cassandras. Perl has been variously accused of [fading](http://www.infoworld.com/%5Bprimary-term-alias-prefix%5D/%5Bprimary-term%5D/whatever-happened-perl-012), [falling](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3026446/the-fall-of-perl-the-webs-most-promising-language), [dying](http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/puramu/perl-is-dead-12264)and [not dying](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-perl). Sometimes this meme takes subtler forms, such as why the Perl subreddit doesn't have [enough subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1sjovo/why_has_rperl_so_few_subscribers/).

### Conclusion

Perl catches all kinds of flak. It [summons daemons](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/87/874c939233c387ca1a1aa84b727178c7585f1a8afbf385ed8484428695fa95ba.jpg), it's [not cool](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/47140545.jpg) and [it will kick you in the balls](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lnPMdjxpfJo/UIpNj3jviTI/AAAAAAAALNE/nG_sATcqE0E/w750-h600-no/Perl+Script+-+Stroll+in+the+park.jpeg). But at least we're being talked about.
