Last month I spoke at The Perl Conference in Alexandria, VA. I presented "What's new on CPAN - annual edition". Here's the video of the talk:

The slides are available as a [pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwRnByTz2iUXcnNYamlSeWVpS0U).

I really enjoyed the conference; as much as I liked the talks, my favorite aspect was meeting lots of friendly fellow Perl coders. It really is a lovely community. I'd also like to thank my employer, [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com) for covering my travel costs for the conference and supporting Open Source.
