.NET is the latest hype blitz from Microsoft (and you thought it was
just a domain). If your eyes are glazing over or you're tempted to write
it off as marketing speak, read on.

Although Microsoft is loath to admit it, .NET is really their answer to
Sun. The Java language, the Java virtual machine and CORBA have proved
to be a threat. .NET is the umbrella name for Microsoft's attempt to
better Sun.

Whereas Java is the programming language for Sun's "computer is the
network" effort, Microsoft has given us C\# ("C sharp"). It's derived
from C, and attempts to avoid some of the pitfalls of Java and C++. And
much as Java compiles down to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instructions,
C\# compiles down to Intermediate Language (IL).

Where Microsoft betters Sun is that while Java is the only real language
that compiles to the JVM ([see update below](#note),) Microsoft intends
IL to be cross-language. That is, Perl, Visual Basic and C\# can be
compiled down to IL. The idea is to make it possible to integrate
multiple languages into one system.

Sun chose CORBA as its distributed application platform, but Microsoft
has gone with SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). In my opinion, SOAP
has one huge benefit over CORBA: mere mortals can implement it! Soap
uses HTTP to send XML-encoded instance and method calls on remotely
defined objects and receive return values. The umbrella term for SOAP
and its cousin XML-RPC is "Web Services." There are already SOAP and
XML-RPC modules for Perl.

While it's still early days for .NET, and there's still considerable
potential for it all to turn out to be vaporware, Microsoft has begun to
release .NET components. And it's not just Microsoft - a number of
people are using SOAP to give concrete APIs to their Web-based systems.
Think of all the times you've tried to parse HTML to extract information
- the SOAP way of the future is for that information to be directly
accessible through SOAP calls. As I said, this is already happening.

I've heard .NET described as "Microsoft's tacit admission that most
shops are not 100 percent Microsoft, so Microsoft products need to work
better with other platforms." There are many places for Perl in this new
world:

-   In the back-end, serving data through SOAP. Be warned that even
    `SOAP::Lite` has a bit of a learning curve, but there are already
    solid modules for this:

    <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SOAP/>

-   In the front-end, compiling down to IL. Jan Dubois of Activestate
    has a research project related to this:

### More Information

So where can you learn more? Microsoft has a lot of information about
.NET, of course.

<http://www.microsoft.com/net/default.asp>

There's an introduction from the Windows point of view (covering the
plans for COM and ADO and all the other Windowsy things I didn't
mention):

<http://www.vbxml.com/xml/articles/dotnetintro/default.asp>

Your best bet for things you can use now, though, are the SOAP and
XML-RPC modules. Be warned: The SOAP modules are hard to get into.

[]{#note}
I meant that while Microsoft is funding and encouraging other languages
to compile down to the IL, Sun never seemed to do that with the JVM. As
far as I could tell (and I am the first to admit that I am on the fringe
of the Java world), their main push was to have Java be The Language.
I'm interested to hear whether they really did encourage other languages
to compile to the JVM.

Poor choice of words on my part, sorry for the confusion. See
[http://grunge.cs.tu-berlin.de/\~tolk/vmlanguages.html for a list of
languages that compile to the
JVM](http://grunge.cs.tu-berlin.de/~tolk/vmlanguages.html).
