Something great is happening in NYC; there are 3 special Perl events happening in the next 3 months!

### Quack & Hack NYC, April 4<sup>th</sup>

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are a privacy-focused search engine with a large Perl codebase and they're hosting the first ever [NYC Quack & Hack](http://duckduckgo.ticketleap.com/quackhacknyc/details) at [AlleyNYC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/500+7th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10018/@40.7531589,-73.9893598,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c259ac7b941903:0xcb0a4d6a0e42963e?hl=en). The focus of the event is creating cheatsheets to support DuckDuckGo help, which seems like a great way to encourage first-time contributors. With free food, drinks and merchandise, and an opportunity to meet new people, this looks like a lot of fun.

### NYC Perl Hackathon, May 2<sup>nd</sup>

The [NYC Perl Hackathon](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki) is back! It's a day-long hackathon, hosted at [Bloomberg](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Bloomberg+Tower+731+Lexington+Ave+New+York,+NY+10022/@40.7615894,-73.9676297,17z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en). The organizers have produced some useful guides on how to [prepare](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki/Getting-Ready-for-the-Hackathon) and what [projects](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki/Projects) are available to hack on. Details can also be found on the New York Perl Mongers' [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-New-York-Perl-Meetup-Group/events/221319780/) page. The hackathon also have several sponsorship [options](https://github.com/nyperlmongers/nyperlhackathon2015/wiki/Sponsorship-Opportunities) for organizations looking to support Perl and promote their brand.

### Mojoconf, June 4<sup>th</sup>-6<sup>th</sup>

[Mojoconf](https://www.mojoconf.com/2015) is a conference about [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/), the real-time web framework. Mojoconf consists of a day of training, a day of talks and a hackathon day. Almost the entire Mojo core dev [team](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojolicious#CORE-DEVELOPERS) will be there, including project founder Sebastian Riedel and Glen Hinkle, author of those wonderful [videos](http://mojocasts.com/e1). You can still get an early-bird [discount](https://www.mojoconf.com/2015/register) for the talks and hackathon until April 10<sup>th</sup>, so grab your ticket now!

### Other stuff

Not far from NYC, the [DC-Baltimore Perl workshop](http://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2015/) is running April 11<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup>, with a day of talks followed by a hackathon. For other events, a good list of global Perl events can be found on [Perl Weekly](http://perlweekly.com/events.html).

I'm going to all 3 New York events, and looking forward to seeing everyone there. So come over and say hi! if you see me.
