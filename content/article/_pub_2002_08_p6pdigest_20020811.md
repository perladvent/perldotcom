Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an
utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think inventing
programming languages is a pretty neat idea.

So, as one amazingly primitive life form to another, here's what's been
going on in Perl 6 development this week. As is becoming tediously
traditional, we'll start with the internals list...

#### [Array vs. PerlArray]{#array_vs._perlarray}

Way back in the mists of a fortnight ago (that's 'two weeks' for the
unenlightened Americans among us.) Melvin Smith announced that he was
thinking about copying some of the fixes that had been made to the
PerlArray PMC over to array.pmc as well. This week, Steve Fink sent in a
patch for an alternative approach, which makes PerlArray a subclass of
Array. Being appropriately lazy, Steve also added some rather useful
looking keywords to the PMC parser, which added some shiny looking OO
features. He then delivered an extended, 3 post monologue in which he
kept replying to himself and refining his explanation of what the patch
did. When he finally stopped talking to himself Dan told him to just
commit it.

A side point in Steve's discussion with himself (and Sean O'Rourke
off-list, apparently) was the idea of dramatically simplifying
default.pmc so it just throws an exception for operations it doesn't
know how to deal with, rather than trying manfully to satisfy the
demands of an unreasonable programmer. Dan reckons he should go ahead
and rip out the old, obsequious code.

#### [Unifying PMCs and Buffers for GC]{#unifying_pmcs_and_buffers_for_gc}

Mike Lambert had stepped up to this task and gave us a brain dump of his
plans. This week Jerome Vouillon wondered about the long term plans for
the Garbage collector, and wondered if we knew how to implement a
generational garbage collector when one has several pools. Dan's long
term plan for the outside world is that 'GC is a black box that just
works.' Internally, he doesn't care, so long as it satisfies the 'just
works' criterion. Mike Lambert thinks that a generational collector
shouldn't be too hard.

Josef 'how do I type "Ã¶" again?' HÃ¶Ã¶k wondered how/if this would affect
his matrix implementation, and when/whether his code would be merged
with the current tree. Dan answered that he was a little concerned about
PMCs which add code to the core, and Josef explained that he wanted to
be able to reuse some of the code in some future multiarray.pmc

#### [Register allocation for the JIT]{#register_allocation_for_the_jit}

Nicholas Clark and Daniel Grunblatt held a learned discussion about
this, with particular reference to the ARM and i386 architectures. There
were diagrams. And discussions of hardware documentation. It was both
scary and surprisingly easy to understand. And a consensus was reached,
which is nice.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20020805215944.GB301%40Bagpuss.unfortu.net)

#### [Stack mark ops & such]{#stack_mark_ops_&_such}

Dan announced that he was 'about half a step from putting pushmark,
popmark, stack marks, and suchlike things into the core.' and that this
was everyone's opportunity to tell him what a bad idea it was. Jerome
Vouillon wondered how they'd interact with continuations and coroutines.
Answer: 'Interestingly'. Jerome offered a code sample which may be
surprising, and asked Dan a hard question. Which Dan hasn't answered
yet.

Melvin Smith wondered if there was a real issue with continuations,
since each continuation got its own copy of the call stack. There is an
issue, but it'll likely be solved by documenting its existence.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a05111b14b973d63571a3%40%5B63.120.19.221%5D)

#### [Exceptions]{#exceptions}

Dan posted his road map to exception handling. Or rather, he described
the two ops (`push` and `throw`) needed to do exception handling, but
punted on what an exception object should look like.

Florian Weimer wondered if it wouldn't be possible to handle exception
objects in the throwing context. Dan reckoned that this could be
problematic, which is why we're not going to do it 'at the moment'.

Jerome wondered if we really needed the `pushx` opcode at all. Tanton
Gibbs disagreed and there was some back and forth about that, and about
whether it made sense to think of a `return` as an exception (it does,
but only rarely, when you're writing your own control structures; Damian
will explain more later).

Dan also thought that `pushx` would be necessary, and Jerome clarified
his suggestion. Simon Glover wondered what happened when a program
didn't define an exception handler and was reassured that there would be
some kind of default (probably language specific) handler in place, and
if an exception got past that then Parrot would handle it itself with a
suitably 'big fit to STDERR' before dying in a fit of pique.

-- Discussion of whether `pushx` is necessary starts here.

#### [Regex speedup]{#regex_speedup}

Angel reposted his patch to the regex subsystem, this time with
appropriate diff flags. Brent Dax needed more clarification, which Angel
gave; Dan accepted that, given docs and tests, the patch could go in.
Angel made another patch with docs and tests, although Mike Lambert then
asked for more clarification, and pointed out some issues with the
`inline` keyword not being standard across all C compilers. He also
wondered if Brent's old 'Tutorial' docs could be updated and reinstated.
Angel responded with more clarification, and a promise that the tutorial
would go in when he'd rewritten it, and commented that 'The previous Rx
version had excellent documentation, so it will take a bit of time to
get there.' I don't think this patch has been applied yet.

#### [Lexicals and globals assembly question]{#lexicals_and_globals_assembly_question}

Brian Wheeler has been looking at `store_lex`, `find_lex`,
`store_global` and `find_global` and pointed out that the `store_*` ops
seemed to be the wrong way round, since the parrot rule is that the
destination is always the first operand. The response to this can be
summed up in one word: "Oops." Brian has patched it, and added tests.
Leopold Toetsch fixed things up in Builtins.pm.

#### [Questions about pdd03\_calling\_conventions.pod]{#questions_about_pdd03_calling_conventions.pod}

Jonathan Sillito asked a few questions about calling conventions, and
noticed that the `callcc` op appeared to be going the way of all flesh.
Dan answered the questions and remarked that callcc was to be reinstated
and shouldn't have disappeared in the first place. Sean O'Rourke
wondered why, since it could be replaced with calls to `invoke` and
other cleverness. Dan agreed. So `callcc` will stay dead. (The only
reason it was on the perch in the first place was because it'd been
*nailed* there.)

#### [Hash optimisations]{#hash_optimisations}

Having had a patch to remove a function call from the hash algorithm
accepted, Jason Greene offered a more comprehensive set of hash
optimisations. Dan applied the patch. Nicholas Clark and Steve Fink had
a few questions. Nicholas wondered why a constant had been changed, and
Steve worried about memory use. Dan reckoned that worrying about memory
to the tune of an unsigned int + alignment bytes at the expense of speed
was the wrong trade-off to make. However, the other subthread had led to
a different design which saved the space and only gave a small
performance hit in the less common case. Dan agreed.

[http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html](http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=16032)

#### [Various PMC issues]{#various_pmc_issues}

Stephen Rawls is still trying to write `tuple.pmc`. Which means he's
been nosing around the sources of all the other PMCs, looking at how
they do things, so, he had a bunch of questions, mostly to do with
PerlNums and PerlInts. The answer to many of the questions appears to be
'the problem will go away when we get multimethod dispatch'. Dan is
pouting because he had 'wanted to go with a left-side-wins scheme, but
alas correctness has trumped speed...'. Dan has promised details of
Parrot multimethods 'soonish'.

#### [Never ending story Keys]{#never_ending_story_keys}

Josef wondered where we are with multi keyed access. Tom Hughes, who has
promised to have a go at fixing things wondered if he was waiting for
hell to freeze over. At which point it started 'snowing in Texas' as Dan
came through with the design. There was much rejoicing, and a snowball
fight was threatened. Tom had some questions (no surprise there: when
you're the one doing the implementation, there's almost never enough
information). Clarification was provided, as were supplementary
questions, and supplementary answers. As Blur put it so eloquently:
"Woohoo!"

#### [Hatchet job on assemble.pl / the fixup table]{#hatchet_job_on_assemble.pl_/_the_fixup_table}

Brian Wheeler took an axe to the assembler and some associated files and
asked for comments on his plans. Dan liked the sound of it, so Brian
posted a patch. Leopold "How do you pronounce" Toetsch suggested making
it a standalone library so stuff could just `use Assembler` instead of
calling yet another external program. Sean O'Rourke asked for a summary
of what had changed, and Brian gave him one. (Oo er).

#### [PMC assignment stuff]{#pmc_assignment_stuff}

Dan has been a positive goldmine of designs and specs this week. This
time he offered the design for a new PMC assignment opcode. We already
have `SET`, which copies the pointers and `CLONE` making a 'full clone',
but we also need `ASSIGN` to 'stuff a value from one PMC to another'.
Peter Gibbs made a start on implementation and asked for some
clarification, which was forthcoming, and then supplied a patch with his
implementation, along with tests. Go Peter!

#### [Status on matrix patch?]{#status_on_matrix_patch}

Josef is worried about what's happening to the matrix patch. Simon
Cozens used this as an opportunity to crack the worst joke yet seen on
any perl6 mailing list, but Josef appears not to have seen the film and
didn't get the joke. Anyhoo, back on the main line of the thread, the
problem seems to be that in order to have things sensibly arranged, it
made sense for Josef to break the `.pmc` file up into a couple of .c and
.h files, along with `matrix.pmc`, but there's currently no scheme for
multi-file PMC classes. Dan also thinks that putting code into the
parrot core just to facilitate code sharing between PMCs is probably not
the right answer. This appears to have opened a can of worms. Dan is
searching for a bigger can -- sorry -- designing the infrastructure that
this needs.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=Pine.GSO.4.21.0208090928370.24176-100000%40chicken.stacken.kth.se)
-- Thread starts here.

-- Terrible joke...

#### [Constant & opcode swap ops]{#constant_&_opcode_swap_ops}

Dan offered designs to support multiple segment bytecodes, or at least,
to swap in constant tables. Steve Fink wondered if it might be a good
idea to wrap the interpreter in a PMC and use vtable methods to do
constant table manipulations etc. Dan thinks that's a great idea for
introspection, but worries that it'll slow things down if we make the
interpreter itself go through those hoops all the time. Nicholas Clark
also offered a few caveats ('Are you *sure* you want to do it this
way?', words to strike fear into the heart of any designer I think). Dan
isn't sure.

#### [Faster assembler]{#faster_assembler}

Nicholas Clark offered a patch which makes
`Assembler::_generate_bytecode` faster. By around 1.5%. Dan applied it.
Sean O'Rourke offered more tweaks. Mattia Barbon had a patch which meant
that the tests could just 'use Parrot::Assembler' rather than call
assemble.pl, but the tweaks have outdated it. Dan and Nicholas asked for
the patch anyway because it would make remaking it easier.

[http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html](http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=16114)

#### [Perl 6 regexes...]{#perl_6_regexes...}

Dan threw down the gauntlet of implementing Perl 6's regexes from
Apocalypse. Sean O'Rourke has apparently already taken it up. I think
we'll be seeing more of this thread next week...

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a05111b05b97cecb019c0%40%5B63.120.19.221%5D)

### [Meanwhile, in perl6-language]{#meanwhile,_in_perl6language}

The terribly named thread about different default values of true and
false rumbled on. Damian averred that code which 'relies on the poorly
specified standard values of truth and falsehood *deserves* to break'.
Damian also argues that Perl ought to have a *proper* boolean type.
After all, it has proper numeric and string types, and that they should
be used by all built ins. (Which does lead me to wonder about code like
`0 but true`). Chip reckons that the standard values of truth and
falsehood aren't *that* badly specified, it's not like they've ever
changed since perl 1, though he does agree that a 'real' boolean would
be nice. Elsewhere in the thread, Chip worried about the scoping of
operator definitions and Damian reassured him a bit.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3D4F0363.3050104%40conway.org)

#### [Use of regular expression on non-strings]{#use_of_regular_expression_on_nonstrings}

Threads in perl6-language seem to be longer lived than those over in
internals. I wonder why? This was another thread that started last week
and kept on going. David Whipp clarified his original question and
various people responded. Err... I'm not entirely sure how to summarise
this one, and following the threading is a tad tricky because Mr Whipp's
mailer doesn't do the `In-Reply-To:` thing.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=F0DF160193C9D511B7110050DA8B7C24384755%40msexchange.intranet.fast-chip.com)
is probably as good a place as any to start looking.

#### [Autovivi]{#autovivi}

Luke Palmer wondered how autovivification was going to work with
specific reference to `print %foo{bar}{baz}`. Would `%foo{bar}` still be
created if it didn't exist? Answer: "NO! Thank ghod!". Unless Larry says
otherwise.

#### [Perl summary for week ending 2002-08-04]{#perl_summary_for_week_ending_20020804}

See recursion. Miko O'Sullivan queried the throw-away comment that
regexes were now called 'rules' and wondered if the term 'regex' would
be going away. It turns out that I wasn't quite accurate, but that
Damian still reckons that 'regexes' should be deprecated in favour of
either 'rules' or 'patterns', at least in his own writing. For some
reason this ended up spinning off into a discussion of regular,
context-free and context-dependent languages and the nitty gritty
details of when an expression was regular or not. Mark J. Reed ended up
posting a fine essay to the list on the differences between the various
types.

#### [`while <> {` in Perl 6]{#while_<>_{_in_perl_6}

Adam Lopresto wondered if the `while (<`) {&gt; idiom (with appropriate
DWIMmery) would be necessary in Perl 6 since, given a lazy list
implementation, one could probably get by with `for <> {`. Trey Harris
agreed. So did Larry, sort of. He's leaning towards only having
`for <> {...}` do implicit topicalisation, `while` will require you to
be explicit (damn, another spamassassin trigger word...).

### [In brief]{#in_brief}

Piers Cawley missed the point about doing copy on write of the entire
stack when doing closuresque things. Various people explained, very
politely that he was wrong. In a moment of selfish editorial wossname,
I'll spare Piers's blushes by omitting the URL.

Josef added a couple of useful ops. Dan applied the patch, but wondered
where the tests were. Josef has, of course, tested the ops, but Dan
wants 'Comprehensive tests in `t/` for everything' so we notice when we
break things later. Nicholas Clark raised the spectre of 'The Schwern
with the big stick.' if we failed to meet that testing goal.

Mike Lambert posted the first of his patches which will, eventually,
unify PMCs and buffers.

Steve Fink posted a patch to convert the hashtable from pointer based to
index based, making the GC system happier. Applied.

Angel Faus posted a 'loop discovery' patch for imcc which attempts to
avoid array spilling whilst in an inner loop. This patch was applied.
Then Leopold Toetsch pointed out a few bugs, and Angel posted another
patch, which hasn't been applied yet.

Andy Dougherty sent some patches to eliminate warnings under Solaris 8.
Applied.

Jarkko sent in more warnings patches. Applied.

Sean O'Rourke offered a patch to hashes to do deep cloning. Dan asked
him to hold on a sec, adding that if he hadn't addressed the issue
inside a day or to we should nudge him. Dan, consider yourself heartily
nudged.

Peter Gibbs has removed the `set_string_unicode` and `set_string_other`
vtable methods, which are, frankly, unnecessary. Leopold caught
`perlundef.pmc`, which had been missed from the original purge.

Jonathan Sillito offered a patch to give scratchpads a pointer to their
parent pads, and ended up with a new Scratchpad PMC. Warnock's Dilemma
applies.

Peter Gibbs offers `perlscalar.pmc`, Aldo Calpini asked a few questions,
and Warnock currently applies.

Daniel Grunblatt announced that the PPC JIT is now working.

Dan noted that there are some size restriction -- we need to make sure
that our chosen INTVAL is at least as big as a pointer. Andy Dougherty
pointed out some possible caveats and noted that his warnings patch gave
some assistance in this area.

Nicholas Clark found a bug in the assembler under perl 5.005\_03. Simon
Glover agreed it was a bug, but nobody is quite sure how to fix it.
Nicholas is working on it though.

Boris "Thank heavens for cut and paste" Tschirschwitz wondered if the
headers of the various PDD (Parrot Design Documents) were kept up to
date, and if he could, in general, trust the docs to be accurate. Dan
reckons they should be mostly up to date. Patches are almost certainly
welcome.

In perl6-language, Chris Dutton wondered if we'd be able to create
anonymous classes ( `my $foo = class {...}` ) in the same way as we
currently create anonymous subs. Personally, I hope so. Chris worries
slightly about ` my $foo_class $foo_obj = $foo_class.new `, but I think
he's getting his compile time and runtime constructs mixed up. But what
do I know?

SpamAssassin marked last weeks summary as spam in some mailboxes. John
Porter suggested that 'Maybe people should add SpamAssassin rule that
deducts 5 points if the message contains /leon brocard/ ?'

### [Acknowledgements, corrections, threats and funding drives]{#acknowledgements,_corrections,_threats_and_funding_drives}

Nicholas Clark would just like to clarify that, as far as right shifts
of signed integers go, we should offer both arithmetic and logical right
shifts. He doesn't appear to have any preference about which should be
the default.

This summary was again prepared with the aid of GNER tea, supplemented
this week by a ham and cheese toasted sandwich, the toasted sandwich of
the gods (though their bacon and tomato toastie also has its adherents I
remain faithful to good old ham and cheese.)

Thanks are also due to the wonderful Pete Sergeant, and to a certain
person who I'll not mention again (but his favourite colour is orange)
for their excellent proofreading skills. Anything which may have snuck
past them (especially in this paragraph) is, of course, entirely my
fault.

If your name appears in this, or any previous summary and you've still
not sent me your answers to the perl6 questionnaire, please consider
doing so. My "Perl 6 Who's who?" archive hasn't run out yet, but it'd be
good to know that I'd got a good supply to fall back on.

Still no T?iBook, but this week's haul of egoboo is well up there. Many
thanks to the flatterers in <perl-golf@perl.org.>

If you didn't like this summary, write your own. Go on, I dare you. If
you did like it, send money to the Perl Foundation at
<http://donate.perl-foundation.org/> and remember, suitably large
donations will earn you or your company a plug in a future summary. (You
have to let me know though). See last week for details. And you'll be
helping to fund the next generation of Perl, which will give you the
warm fuzzies and a general feeling of virtue and well being. In the
words of Mrs Doyle, "Go on, go on, go on, go on!"
