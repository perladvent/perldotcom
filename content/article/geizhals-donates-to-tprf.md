Today The Perl and Raku Foundation is thrilled to announce a donation of USD
10,000 from [Geizhals Preisvergleich](https://geizhals.at). This gift helps to
secure the future of The Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund.

> Perl has been an integral part of our product price comparison platform
> from the start of the company 25 years ago. Supporting the Perl 5 Core
> Maintenance Fund means supporting both present and future of a
> substantial pillar of Modern Open Source Computing, for us and other
> current or prospective users.

-- Michael KrÃ¶ll of Geizhals Preisvergleich

Geizhals Preisvergleich (literally [Skinflint Price
Comparison](https://skinflint.co.uk/)) began in July of 1997 as a hobby project
and has leveraged the power of Perl to scale up to serving [4.3 million monthly
users](https://unternehmen.geizhals.at/). With Perl being a key part of their
infrastructure, they have have generously decided to support the Perl 5 Core
Maintenance Fund.

Many of use are familiar with the Core 5 Maintenance Fund, but we may not have
a clear idea of which problems it actually solves. I reached out to the
maintainers whose work is supported by this fund. This is what core maintainer
Tony Cook had to say:

> My work tends to be little things, I review other people's work which I think
> improves quality and velocity, and fix more minor issues, some examples would
> be:
>
> - a fix to signal handling where perl could crash where an external library
>   created threads ([#22487](https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/22487))
>
> - fix a segmentation fault in smartmatch against a sub if the sub exited via a
>   loop exit op (such as last)
>   ([#16608](https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16608))
>
> - fixed a bug where a regexp warning could leak memory.
>
> - prevent a confusing undefined warning message when accessing a sub
>   parameter that was placeholder for a hash element indexed by an
>   undef key ([#22423](https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/22423))

What Tony has highlighted are the kinds of bug fixes which collectively help to
ensure that Perl remains stable, secure and reliable for the many organisations
and individuals who depend on it.

With organizations like Geizhals Preisvergleich funding the work which Tony and
others put into maintaining the Perl 5 core, we can work together to ensure that
the Perl core continues to receive the maintenance which it deserves, for many
years to come. Whether you're a startup using Perl for rapid prototyping or an
enterprise running mission-critical systems, your support helps ensure Perl
remains reliable for everyone. Please join us on this journey.
