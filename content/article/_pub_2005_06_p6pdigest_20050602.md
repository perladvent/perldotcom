All\~

Welcome to another Perl 6 summary, brought to you by Aliya's new
friends, Masha Nannifer and Philippe, and my own secret running joke.
Without further ado, I bring you Perl 6 Compiler.

### Perl 6 Compiler

#### [Method Chaining](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/896e66b5cef6d677/e8f9ca07d7b1dc6f#e8f9ca07d7b1dc6f)

Alex Gutteridge discovered that he couldn't chain attribute access such
as `$bowl.fish.eyes.say;` in Pugs. Later he provided his example in test
form (in case anyone wanted to add it). Maybe someone added them, maybe
not; Warnock applies.

#### [Pugs Link Issues on Debian Sid](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/12735f0c524edb53/bdc3f08faf125f5f#bdc3f08faf125f5f)

BÃRTHÃZI AndrÃ¡s had trouble making Pugs work on Debian Sid with Perl 5
support. Autrijus provided helpful pointers. I assume from his final
silence that the final pointer worked.

#### [`Pugs.AST.*` Compilation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/70f338f3a2256f07/13d6ee45390ecb00#13d6ee45390ecb00)

Samuel Bronson wanted to speed up the compilation of `Pugs.AST.*`
modules by turning off optimizations. Autrijus told him that this was a
core module that needed its speed, and optimizations would stay.

#### [`Pugs.Types` Export List](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/a13a6669f7555211/29fa93e63a1859e8#29fa93e63a1859e8)

Samuel Bronson added an export list to `Pugs.Types`. Autrijus happily
applied it and sent him a commit bit.

#### [Export `withArgs` from `Main`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/fb0bfd20062be074/89c3a26a58d0566a#89c3a26a58d0566a)

Samuel Bronson added an export to `Main`. Samuel Bronson happily applied
it himself this time.

#### [Out-of-Date hs-plugins](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/473d55dfb23cb82b/dfb2bf1285cb5d68#dfb2bf1285cb5d68)

Vadim had trouble compiling Pugs with Parrot support. Autrijus helped
him fix his problem, and there was much rejoicing.

#### [`chomp` Problem](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/146f4e62d950196a/b457fd0e6bac2224#b457fd0e6bac2224)

Jens Rieks found a problem with `chomp` and submitted a test. Warnock
applies.

#### [Pugs *makefile* Issue](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/e9da852ea30990fc/11806b69b57c9a53#11806b69b57c9a53)

GrÃ©goire PÃ©an noticed that Pugs was creating a useless *Pugs.exe.bat*.
Autrijus asked if he would be willing to investigate a patch. He
responded that he would put it in his queue.

#### [`loop` or `do`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/43829f825c10b04e/80f020826b1ec28b#80f020826b1ec28b)

Gerd Pokorra wondered why `do { ... }` was in Pugs, reasoning that
`loop { ... } while` was the correct thing. Luke Palmer explained that
`do { ... }` was part of the with-or-without-a-postfix `while`.

#### [PxPerl 5.8.6.2 with Pugs 6.2.5 and Parrot 0.2.0](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/44797562829e45bf/0ec9118d0a5df14e#0ec9118d0a5df14e)

GrÃ©goire PÃ©an announced the release of PxPerl 5.8.6.2, which includes
Pugs 6.2.5 and Parrot 0.2.0. This means that Windows folk can test Pugs
and Parrot without having to fight with compilers.

#### [`BUILD` Errors](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/c8d85c57fa0cd9d7/e8d11297c80c534b#e8d11297c80c534b)

Carl Franks found the handling of a named argument to a constructor
confusing. He asked for confirmation but no one provided it. Perhaps
this poor summary can save him.

#### [White Space and Function Calls](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/2cd54cc42ccc7faf/e229eeb82b638977#e229eeb82b638977)

David D. Zuhn didn't know about the forbidding of white space between a
function call and its parentheses. Carl told him that and about the
`.()` variant that allows white space.

#### [Pug's `make clean` Issues *Long* Commands](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/0ad94f1b41e69ee1/1db579766f53aa86#1db579766f53aa86)

Carl Franks noticed that `make clean` issued a command so long that it
broke his `nmake`. Fortunately he had a really old `nmake` and updating
fixed the problem.

### Parrot

#### [*thr\_windows.h* with MinGW](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/081cb54a4ed511fe/67a7f34afdf97217#67a7f34afdf97217)

FranÃ§ois Perrad provided a patch fixing two compilation problems in
*thr\_windows.h*. Warnock applies.

#### [Parrot Slides?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/42f822db3b2b4c7d/e40c457dca60a311#e40c457dca60a311)

Adam Preble posted a request for slides and notes on Parrot and Perl 6
for a presentation he was working on. Many people provided links in
various languages. I usually steal from Dan's presentations when I need
something like this.

#### [Problems with Perl 5.6.1](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e4f90647f62c3661/0a9baaa67250616b#0a9baaa67250616b)

FranÃ§ois Perrad had a problem building Parrot with MinGW and Perl 5.6.1,
related to Windows and its binary vs. text distinction. This problem
will also crop up if you ever try to `seek` on files in Windows; not
that I have ever lost several days debugging that problem.

#### [Ordered Hash Thoughts](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/86466b906c8e6e10/24a935c5c2c71aa8#24a935c5c2c71aa8)

Leo posted his thoughts on a modification to ordered hash, as adding a
new element by index breaks the string-hashing part of it. Dan suggested
that the ordered hash just pitch exceptions in the bad cases, as it was
designed to be lightweight and fast.

#### [Subrules Tests](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c600922a3fcec692/759e9ee7e172f6ad#759e9ee7e172f6ad)

Dino Morelli provided a patch adding tests for subrules to PGE. Warnock
applied, at least until Patrick read this summary.

#### [Python on Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ea055b495d6878a2/23a59ac23ea8606d#23a59ac23ea8606d)

Bloves inquired as to the state of Python on Parrot. The phrasing of the
question itself provided some confusion. Michal Wallace provided a link
to Pirate, hoping it would help.

#### [`Resizable*Array` Defeats *list.c*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7c24021ab507253d/855d8042ec831341#855d8042ec831341)

Slowly but steadily, my `{Fixed,Resizable}<type>Array` PMCs are
defeating the less consistent array implementations. Leo offered the job
of slaying *list.c* to any interested party. Jerry Gay expressed
interest.

#### [Encodings on "Char Constants"](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d71521e3e4e51418/b4da146647db3e6c#b4da146647db3e6c)

Bob Rogers wants to be able to supply an encoding for his character
constants that use `'`. He also wanted to find the integer that
corresponds to a character. Leo explained how he could do the former and
that `ord` is useful for the latter.

#### [Broken Links](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/01803083e71e519c/05c4703b1d5e89b4#05c4703b1d5e89b4)

Fayland Lam pointed out that the links from the last summary were a
little broken. Hopefully this summary will be better.

#### [Refcounts and DOD](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3f1726696d729ec9/c791d65ce745c731#c791d65ce745c731)

Michal Wallace wondered how best to make Python's refcounts work for
embedding it in Parrot. Nicholas Clark pointed out that
`Parrot_[un]register_pmc` would work. Dan noted that if the Python
library were to become a Parrot extension, these could become no-ops as
Parrot's DOD would do the necessary work.

#### [`BigInt` Fixes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c581e03e878f4d8a/d5f8daa08f078f3c#d5f8daa08f078f3c)

Kevin Tew added some tests and fixes to *BigInt.pmc*. Leo applied the
patch.

#### [MinGW and GMP](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a09a64c88328db95/b9c59f2722a5f595#b9c59f2722a5f595)

FranÃ§ois Perrad provided a patch fixing GMP for MinGW. Leo provided a
slight correction, which FranÃ§ois incorporated. Leo then applied the
patch.

#### [`index` Failures](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c81da92bc01890a5/6a6dd5a236cf22eb#6a6dd5a236cf22eb)

Roger Browne found a failure in the `index` opcode. Leo fixed it.

#### [MinGW and GDBM](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/33dfb7a365e4a083/fe4b4af306994134#fe4b4af306994134)

FranÃ§ois Perrad provided a patch fixing GDBMfor MinGW. Leo applied the
patch.

#### [`mod` Operation Fails with Negative Integers](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8894e415b47b8d24/a2ed829260b2d8dc#a2ed829260b2d8dc)

Roger Browne noticed that `mod`ing with or by negative integers could
produce negatives, such as `3 mod -3 = -3`. Leo fixed them to provide 0.
I hate that fact about C; not that I have ever lost several days
debugging that problem, either.

#### [Tracing and Debugging](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f40aab493be196c2/5d73d39d325ac0df#5d73d39d325ac0df)

Leo noted that debugging Parrot has grown more difficult, as the number
of abstractions has increased. Is your compiler, IMCC, your PMC, or
Parrot broken? Maybe two or three of them? To facilitate debugging, Leo
suggested a `debug_break` opcode and a `Debugger` PMC. It sounds nifty.
He also added support for lexically scoped trace and debug flags.

#### [Adding Unicode, Hex, and Octal Escapes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/72ffc881d1d75457/f85ac2dda841e70f#f85ac2dda841e70f)

Will Coleda added more complete escape sequence support to Tcl. Matt
Diephouse integrated the patch into his latest version.

#### [the State of ParTcl](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3bba0dbcc811c84d/ad2ff9ee718948b2#ad2ff9ee718948b2)

Will Coleda proudly noted that as of r8193, ParTcl passed all tests,
even with `gc-debug`. Much praise goes to Matt Diephouse for his cleanup
of the Tcl parser.

#### [Strength Reduction Optimization](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0dcc4f1f752418ce/0c782ec5ad4c954e#0c782ec5ad4c954e)

Curtis Rawls provided a flurry of patches improving Parrot's strength
reduction optimization. Leo applied the patches.

#### [TODO: `readline` Support](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/82f5be5069a649b7/97de5fb125248fdc#97de5fb125248fdc)

Leo put out a request for adding `readline` support to Parrot.

#### [`get_mmd_dispatch_type` Fix](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/4533f856ba99f0ae/d00c8b88bcfbd51b#d00c8b88bcfbd51b)

Vladimir Lipsky provided a patch that fixes a bug in *mmd.c*. Leo
applied it.

#### [Uninitialized Variable](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2f5aa6c61a77aa58/40d686bdf7e7eee9#40d686bdf7e7eee9)

Vladimir Lipsky fixed an uninitialized variable. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Improved `loadlib` Handling](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9491a345632a0111/0a09d861dccc0018#0a09d861dccc0018)

Bob Rogers improved `loadlib`'s handling of absolute paths. Leo applied
the patch.

#### [DOD Sweep Fix](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b3bca2ddf30f69ce/17b19f2de2b3ecd2#17b19f2de2b3ecd2)

Vladimir Lipsky prevented the NULL `PMC_EXT` from being added to the PMC
`ext` pool during a DOD sweep. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Packfile Double Destroy](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3773a79fd720ee41/2cd1145fa93e777d#2cd1145fa93e777d)

Vladimir Lipsky fixed a problem with double destruction of nested
packfiles. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Tcl Autoconverts List &lt;-&gt; String](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0182c9ebfb0736bb/d531fecfb9c449a5#d531fecfb9c449a5)

Tcl can autoconvert between lists and strings. Will Coleda wondered how
to implement this behavior to best support language interoperability.
People offered suggestions, but there was no real agreement on the best
solution, though.

#### [TODO Classification](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/952a2970ad1a2aaa/64d83aa594a8438b#64d83aa594a8438b)

Chromatic, inspired by Pugs, added TODO classification to Parrot::Test.
He threatened to apply the patch if there were no objections ... none
yet.

#### [HLL Group Support](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/75ed82ed26e93acf/a3e9619005dbeba1#a3e9619005dbeba1)

Leo added support for loading high-level language PMC groups dynamically
using the `.HLL` directive. This will load the lib dynamically and
change the return type of some ops to reflect the HLL's preferences. It
is nifty.

#### [Pistol-Wielding Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/56d66dd2f4202b8c/acea6702a7bdbeb4#acea6702a7bdbeb4)

Leo put out a request for PIR versions of the [Computer Language
Shootout](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/) tests. This will provide a
means of gauging Parrot's performance against other languages. Kinda
nifty.

#### [`nmake` v1.5 Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7280549fef836ac0/8255877b03808230#8255877b03808230)

Nigel Sandever also had trouble with overly long lines and `nmake`.
Upgrading `nmake` fixed his problem, too.

#### [Optimizer Producing Bad Code](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e7df5b27c42f22e6/8a84a8e385b74ec1#8a84a8e385b74ec1)

Nick Glencross noticed that the optimizer was producing some bad code.
Leo fixed one of the problems, but missed the other.

#### [Keys Design](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0b09cf75ebded75b/a3ac293d1aaace86#a3ac293d1aaace86)

Dan posted an explanation of his original design for keys.

#### [Loop Improvements](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ef896a743922b55e/91db59b1a73aee04#91db59b1a73aee04)

Curtis Rawls provided a patch to improve the loop struct in the IMCC
optimizer. Leo applied it and asked if he would take a whack at reducing
the resource consumption of Bill Coffman's register allocation patch.
Dan and Bob Rogers both expressed interested in speeding up the
compiler.

### Perl 6 Language

#### [Hash Slices](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/fe42b63a7e74721b/04e18f0b56fb64b3#04e18f0b56fb64b3)

Carl Franks thought he was having trouble with hash slices. Actually he
was having trouble with the `s/->/./` in his Perl 5 conversion.

#### [Perl 6 and Refactoring Support](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/89fb02214da27797/0409dbac1ab2d41a#0409dbac1ab2d41a)

Piers Cawley resurrected Matisse Enzer's thread about IDEs and tools for
Perl 6. He observed that Perl 6 might provide a great deal of support
for such things. Deborah Pickett noted that it might not be
theoretically possible to parse Perl 6 safely. Luke Palmer felt that it
would not be possible, given `BEGIN` blocks and the like.

#### [`$*OS but OS::unix`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6f589edd45ffad1e/2eb118f67d19a368#2eb118f67d19a368)

Rob Kinyon suggested that `$*OS` be a class that mixes in the correct
`OS::class`. Then MMD could do the heavy lifting. I like this idea.

#### [Reduction Junctions and Cribbage Scoring](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/35f6c8d0d9aa4371/5eaac5d52de792d6#5eaac5d52de792d6)

Rob Kinyon wanted to use junctions and reductions to score cribbage
hands. Unfortunately, he used junctions as a set. This led to
discussions of the correct implementation, and of a Set module that
should be part of Perl 6. I want such a set module to have a powerset
function that returns the powerset of a particular set (preferably
lazily instantiated). Also, my cribbage scoring algorithm is better: 1)
lay down hand, 2) announce score, 3) peg.

#### [Syntax for Using Perl 5](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8843447d9562a359/79007e1d5ba75d38#79007e1d5ba75d38)

Autrijus added support to Pugs for using Perl 5 modules. This led him to
wonder what the correct syntax for this actually was. Many suggestions,
but no decisions, arrived.

#### MMD and SMD Interaction

Yuval Kogman wondered how MMD and SMD would interact. Warnock applied.

#### [Making Perl 6 Grammars Generative](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3ba81c6b33ec5605/db8a961b884b69ae#db8a961b884b69ae)

Aufrank wondered if Perl 6 grammars could be made generative. I would
say that this does not belong in the core simply because of its niche
application; however, if I were to do this, I would start by using the
Perl 6 grammar grammar and modify the way the parse tree is used. Sadly,
aufrank posted to Google Groups, so nobody else expressed opinions.

#### [Links and References](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3d1ff082d4338b04/bd268cbd6f0eb52a#bd268cbd6f0eb52a)

Thomas SandlaÃ suggested a `Link` class to fill the role of
auto-dereferencing variables that Luke called "transparent" references.

#### [Use Syntax](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b9b8fb5488a7da33/7e2fe8ee49ea4132#7e2fe8ee49ea4132)

Rob Kinyon wondered how exactly ranges of versions and multi-language
interoperability would work in Perl 6. Rod Adams provided a few answers.

#### [Anonymous Classes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a5c5cdb1a30742ce/fedb6c6b85ae2f0c#fedb6c6b85ae2f0c)

Simon Cozens announced that he was having a lot of fun converting
Maypole to Perl 6. Then he asked how make anonymous subclasses that
inherit from other classes and add new methods. Ingo Blechschmidt
provided the answers.

#### [Introspectable Code Objects](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/fe1eb1f7887a4625/0a739544e951e569#0a739544e951e569)

Ingo Blechschmidt thought it would be nifty if code objects were fully
introspectable. Luke agreed, but felt that being able to access them at
the statement level might be problematic. I think most of what Ingo
would want this for is doable with macros that parse normally (or modify
a block), but then munge the resulting match object appropriately.

#### [Signatures As First-Class Types](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bf516a1c019f25b1/fad6bfc4f1650717#fad6bfc4f1650717)

Yuval Kogman hoped that signatures would be available as first-class
types in Perl 6. Ingo Blechschmidt agreed. Sam Vilain pointed to the
start of such a translation.

#### [`new` and MMD](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8f03c86d34ed66e2/4e33e251e46fa668#4e33e251e46fa668)

Carl Franks wanted to create a specialized on arguments to `new` using
MMD. Damian told him that his technique was a way to do it, and that
`bless` would still call `BUILDALL`.

#### [Code Ownership and Debuggability](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b5bc2a3c0bec2d57/c0a0aa45d2cf43cd#c0a0aa45d2cf43cd)

Yuval Kogman posted his thoughts on code ownership and debuggability in
the age of frameworks and generated code.

#### [Strongly Typed Containers](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/99b61afd411441c3/5377eb7fe6083922#5377eb7fe6083922)

Yuval Kogman wondered how to make a strongly typed container class
(similar to C++ templates). Sam Villain provided a pointer to earlier
threads and mentioned Haskell's Generic Algebraic Data Types.

#### [Constants and Optimizations](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d60365097dfc4f24/55b6d56db611c9c6#55b6d56db611c9c6)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered how to create constants so that the optimizer
would be able to do as much as possible. Damian suggested that macros
would be one solution. This makes me wonder if there is a way to declare
a function so that the compiler can create a macro version for constants
automatically. That would be nifty.

#### [Date/Time Formatting](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9c02afd5621d8f36/065dacbad0d9ddcd#065dacbad0d9ddcd)

Nathan Gray wondered what sort of date/time formating Perl 6 would
support. Rob Kinyon suggested porting `DateTime`. This certainly sounds
like something that belongs in a module.

#### [And Pow, I Found Illumination](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/60859d989e786eec/130fd7a73ed5bb7d#130fd7a73ed5bb7d)

After much discussion, @Larry has weighed in on the thread I started
about reductions on empty lists. Damian feels that it should fail, as
finding an appropriate identity operator is no simple task. Somehow a
discussion of modulus and division slipped in too.

#### [Sub Call Versus MMD](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/952a0bb378deaa92/ecc8fdcafb41ff92#ecc8fdcafb41ff92)

Luke Palmer wanted a sanity check on sub calls versus MMD. Larry
provided an answer, but did not weigh in on his sanity.

#### [`(1,(2,3),4)[2]`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c5d553fa29733b95/d434d39327b75214#d434d39327b75214)

People continue to feel very divided about `(1,(2,3),4)[2]` and
`@x = [1,2,3]`. There are strong opinions on both sides about arrayrefs
in array and scalar contexts. I appear to be allied with the losing
side. Hopefully things will change.

#### [Unicode Cheat Sheet](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ef172220cda5a462/710cc944649b901a#710cc944649b901a)

Rob Kinyon posted a request for a Unicode cheat sheet so he could make
his own nifty symbols. Gaal Yahas and Sam Vilain provided pointers.

#### [Comprehensive List of Rules Tokens](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/e9cfaffbe7ce5364/2335c47b32fa6af6#2335c47b32fa6af6)

Jeff Pinyan wants a comprehensive list of Perl 6 rule tokens so he can
create a Perl 5 module to parse them. Much discussion ensued.

#### [Default Invocant of Methods](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0d33ae0ce9a439fa/cb997504f9511ada#cb997504f9511ada)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered if a method's `Class` could be a default
invocant or only instances of it. Somehow this led Larry to musing about
`Class` as a role than people can mixin instead of inherit from. He
confuses me.
