## The Guilt<br>

I consider myself successful.<br>
I'm 45, with a sportscar, a house, a family, and a small business now 30 years old.<br>
I made good decisions.<br>
My car is 15-years old, my monitors are 20-years old, my chair is 25-years old, my desk is 25-years old.<br>
My computers historically last 10-years; I just tossed a mouse that survived 8-years.<br>
Perl.<br>
My first venture into server-side web development was Lotus Notes...that lasted 5 days.<br>
Perl has lasted me nearly 30 years, and we sure as hell ain't done yet!<br>

I didn't meet the perl community until the Toronto conference in 2023.<br>
That's where I saw the faces.<br>
That's when I saw the humanity.<br>
That's why I felt the guilt.<br>

I'd paid for my car, for my house, for my computers, my desk, and my chair.<br>
Perl came for free.<br>
I didn't pay for it; I didn't work for it.<br>
But at the conference, before me stood the people who did.<br>

I've worked hard for my success.<br>
It's clear to me now that I wasn't the only one working hard for my success.<br>
How much of your success is because of all of their hard work?<br>
And how much have you contributed in return?<br>
Me? I contributed absolutely nothing.<br>

That's my guilt.<br>
But this is the very best kind of guilt.<br>
Because it's not too late!<br>
In fact, now is the perfect time.<br>

I've hired members of the perl community.<br>
That's a start.<br>
I'm donating directly to the foundation.<br>
And I intend to continue doing so.<br>
If my success depends on perl, then perl depends on my success.<br>


## The Pleasure

Perl was always a perfect fit for me.<br>
As a syntax, it was concise, yet flexible.<br>
My code's form could mirror its function.<br>
How perfectly splendid.<br>

Perl is the basis of Holophrastic's web development platform: Pipelines.<br>
As new popular languages have come along, they're touted as the best new amazing modern.<br>
And then they vanish, supplanted by the very next amazing.<br>
Had I invested in each, I'd have more archives of code than formats of music albums.<br>

Instead, I rest easy in the knowledge that perl will always keep up.<br>
xls, xlsx, pdf, mysql, mariadb, imagemagick, json, curl<br>
There will always be a cpan module waiting for me when I need it.<br>
My clients have no idea the power that I wield with my fingertips.<br>
AI translations, image processing craziness, survey systems built for 100'000 concurrent test-takers...<br>
And while all of that definitely took some expertise on my end,<br>
Perl created exactly zero hurdles,<br>
It never got in the way at all.<br>

Longevity.<br>
Perl's got it.<br>
The Perl Foundation's got it.<br>
The Perl Community's got it.<br>
I've got it.<br>
The lines between?  All blurry.<br>

## Holophrastic Enterprises Inc.

Custom Business Web Development<br>

I work as what I'd call an inside-contractor.<br>
I'm a speed-dial (is that still a thing?) phone call away.<br>
Occasionally, a client will call me a dozen times in a day.<br>
I'm closer than their coleague in the next office.<br>

It usually starts with "a website"<br>
the typical sales- or marketing-oriented something-pretty<br>

Then business takes over.<br>
A product-configuration wizard<br>
A sales-commission calculator<br>
Can you connect to our accounting software and provide the reports that it can't?<br>
Can you replace our warehouse-production backend?<br>
What about a portal?<br>

Yes; yes I can.<br>
One business obstacle at a time.<br>

Now, 30 years later, I often encounter code & comments, decades old.<br>
The feeling I get from seeing a line that's now older than the me who wrote it...<br>
I used to feel alone.<br>
I now feel that thanks to the perl community, I was never alone.<br>
