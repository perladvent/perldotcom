Welcome back to another Perl 6 summary in which Piers comes back from
watching a load of pretty girls dancing 'round a huge Maypole in Wellow
(it's 60 feet high, the tallest permanent Maypole in England, there's
been on on the site since at least 1856. One does wonder if the Lord of
the Manor who put the first one up was compensating for something). It's
not my favourite English traditional event (you'd have to go a long way
to beat the Whitby Penny Hedge for weirdness or the Brockworth Hill
cheese-rolling for complete and utter reckless insanity (it was called
off this year because the people who usually provide cover in case of
accidents are in Algeria helping deal with the aftermath of the
earthquake there; St John's Ambulance didn't feel up to the rigours of
dealing with the kind of injuries that occur when too many people chase
a Double Gloucester cheese down a 1 in 2 slope.)) but it made for a
lovely afternoon.

Which is why, instead of having this written by mid afternoon on a
Monday, I'll be lucky if I have it finished before Tuesday. Ah... the
trials of a summary writer.

So, we'll start with perl6-internals because that's what we always do.

[IMCC variable names]{#imcc_variable_names}
-------------------------------------------

Will Coleda discovered that IMCC didn't allow him to have a variable
name that happened to be the same as an op, which isn't what the spec
says and which could lead to interesting problems where IMCC source code
suddenly becomes invalid when someone adds a new op to the language.
Will sent a patch to fix the docs. Leo Tötsch didn't apply the patch,
choosing to fix the problem instead. Yay Leo.

[Vtables get macroized]{#vtables_get_macroized}
-----------------------------------------------

Leo Tötsch finished checking a series of patches which switch the Parrot
source code over from accessing vtable innards directly to accessing
them via macros, thus making it easier to monkey with vtable internals
without having to change a million and one different source files.

[The timely destruction thread]{#the_timely_destruction_thread}
---------------------------------------------------------------

After last week's discussion of timely destruction, the debate continued
this week. Dan announced his design for dealing with the issue. PMCs now
get a flag marking them as requiring timely destruction and there's a
new op to trigger a DOD run if and only if there are any flagged PMCs in
memory. The idea is that compilers for languages that care about timely
destruction would insert the `lazysweep` op into their generated code in
the appropriate places. Mr. Zellyn Hunter (hey, that's what he asked to
be called, who am I to argue?) suggested a different name for Dan's
proposed flag and offered the following joke which I repeat here in its
entirety because it's funny (because it's \*true\*).

Q: How many Parrot programmers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

A: Just one, as long as it's Leo Tötsch. He will probably also rewire
your entire electrical system slightly, saving you about 3% in power
consumption during the evenings and on weekends.

Leo denied the truth of this as lightbulbs are hardware and he doesn't
do hardware.

Meanwhile, back at the thread...

Guess what? People didn't like the solution. I think this is a classic
problem of GC. Everyone agrees that real Garbage Collection is a good
idea, but they also want it to work by magic and take no time at all.
Sadly, whilst Leo is good, even he can't change the laws of physics. My
suggestion: if you're currently writing Perl code that relies on magic
to close a filehandle the instant it goes out of scope then Don't Do
That, close it yourself. That way, when you come to switch things over
to Perl 6 you can do `use GC scope_end => undef` (or something) and get
blistering performance and real GC.

[PASM code analysis]{#pasm_code_analysis}
-----------------------------------------

Clinton A Pierce has rewritten BASIC's expression evaluator and is
reintegrating it with the runtime. This has left a lot of 'junk code'
that never actually gets executed, and Clint wanted to know if there was
a way of tracking down (and removing) the unreachable code. Leo implied
that the answer is 'run it under IMCC' which apparently does dead code
detection. This didn't quite work for Clint as IMCC threw an error when
it tried to run some BASIC generated PASM (at least, it does when run in
dead code detection mode...) Leo wasn't able to help directly with
tracking down the issue, but did provide some pointers for conversion of
the BASIC compiler so that it targets IMCC's PIR language instead of
simple Parrot assembly. This prompted a list of questions from Clint
about IMCC and Luke Palmer provided a some good answers.

[Perl 6 Essentials]{#perl_6_essentials}
---------------------------------------

Sean O'Rourke noticed the new Perl 6 book in O'Reilly's catalogue and
wondered where Leo found the time to become an author as well as a
coding machine. Dan popped up to note that the plan is to have the book
available in time for OSCON and YAPC::Europe. (Be there or be somewhere
else). Randal Schwartz mentioned that he'd been a tech reviewer for the
book and had found it 'quite an interesting read'.

[A New PMC Layout]{#a_new_pmc_layout}
-------------------------------------

Leo Tötsch posted a proposed new layout for PMCs now that PMC access has
been hidden behind macros and asked for comments on his proposed new
scheme for the new PMC layout. Dan commented on this, and between them
he and Leo appear to have hashed out a way forward. Leo kicked out a
patch using the new PMC scheme, with a second version not long after.

[Meanwhile in perl6-language]{#meanwhile_in_perl6language}
==========================================================

Things have started to pick up a little after the virtual silence of the
past few weeks.

[Perl 6 Tutorial?]{#perl_6_tutorial}
------------------------------------

Dulcimer wondered if anyone was working on a simple introductory
tutorial for Perl 6 yet. He thought that writing one might help get him
up to speed, especially if people on the list critiqued it as he wrote
it. Michael Lazzaro pointed to the documentation list
*<perl6-documentation@perl.org>* which is apparently rather quiet at the
moment. Dave Whipp wasn't sure that the time was right to write a
tutorial yet as we don't yet know enough about the final language
(Personally I think anyone attempting to write a Perl 6 tutorial before
the object system gets designed/documented is going to end up having to
do some fairly dramatic rewriting at some point).

Anyhoo, this led to a string of suggestions trying to sum up the Spirit
of Perl 6, one of which managed to be a spoiler for Buffy the Vampire
Slayer...

Simon Cozens also nodded towards the forthcoming *Perl 6 Essentials*
which may be just what Dulcimer is after.

[Coroutines]{#coroutines}
-------------------------

Discussion of Coroutines in Perl 6 was the thread that ate the list this
week. John Macdonald, had a few observations about using coroutines and
suggestions for the best semantics for them in Perl 6. There seems to be
a split between those who want the caller to know it's calling a
coroutine and those who want the coroutine to be invisible to the
caller. Halfway along the thread, Damian wrote up a proposal which he
hoped would make everyone happy. It didn't succeed, but it was at least
a step forward as the proposal got batted back and forth a few times,
leading to another proposal which got batted back and forth a few more
times and which received far more acclaim.

Damian's proposals introduced a new `coro` declarator for coroutines,
which Piers Cawley thought wasn't really necessary, and there was some
discussion about whether 'coroutineness' was something that could be
applied to all sorts of different Code based things, in which case using
new declarators could lead to ugliness (coro, comethod, coblock,
corule...) or if there was only really one thing. The jury is out on
this.

There was also discussion of possibly unifying coroutine and threading
syntax, which some people thought was cool and which others disliked
intensely (nothing new there then).

There was also discussion of what a coroutine is, and why you would want
to use them. Damian gave a good explanation of some of this. Actually,
Damian gave some really good philosophy in this thread about why he
likes Perl.

Elsewhere in the thread, some fool called Piers Cawley attempted to
introduce a discussion of multimethods and failed dismally to change the
subject line. Bad Piers.

[Warnock's Dilemma]{#warnock's_dilemma}
---------------------------------------

The eponymous Bryan C. Warnock (note to any Wired Jargonwatch editors
who may be watching, that's *Bryan*, not 'Brian') popped up to set the
record straight about his dilemma. Delightfully, by the end of the week,
nobody had replied to him.
