Larry's State of the Onion presentation this year was, as every year,
completely different from previous years. As he noted, previous talks
have been about chemistry, theology, biology, and music; this year, for
once, Larry actually talked about Perl.

And this year the format was rather different. Based on the success of
the lightning talks at previous Perl conferences, Larry decided to adopt
this for his presentation - he gave us thirty-three lightning talks of
fifty-five seconds each, with his daughter Heidi ruthlessly manning the
bell. So ruthless, in fact, that Larry had to encourage us to laugh
quickly to avoid cutting into his talking time.

### Perl 6 and Apocalypses

Larry talked about both Perl 5 and Perl 6. He noted that many talented
people were putting dedication and love into Perl 5, and Perl 5 is doing
great. So much for Perl 5.

Perl 6 was obviously the major focus of Larry's talk, with each
lightning talk laying out the major points of an Apocalypse. As before,
Apocalypses mirrored chapters of the Camel book, [Programming
Perl](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/).

Larry hinted that he'd already recanted part of the [second
Apocalypse](http://perl.com/pub/a/2001/05/03/wall.html); the third
Apocalypse was due to come out, but Larry got sick. On the other hand,
this gave him a chance to go slowly, and to do it right.

So his lightning talks really began with apocalypse three, about
operators. Larry noted that there had been a number of very specific
proposals, but he wanted to concentrate on generalities. He also said
that he was wavering on the idea of user-defined operators, and
particularly Unicode operators. `->` will become `.` - start accepting
that now. This will mean that the concatenation operator will have to
change, and this will probably become `~`.

The bell tolled, and so Larry had to move onto talk four - control
structures. To loud applause, he announced that Perl 6 would include a
switch statement; to some bemusement, however, he let on that it would
be called "`given`" - case statements would be called "`when`". Another
notable renaming: "`local`" will become "`temp`".

Larry reiterated the need for optional type and property declarations;
this isn't the same as typing, but it's a way of specifying metadata
about a variable or subroutine. As you supply Perl with more metadata
about variables, it will gain efficiency in terms of storage and
manipulation. As the bell went, Larry was just explaining how 90% of
code wouldn't get that much faster but...

### Regular Expressions, Formats, Packages and Modules

Larry's been thinking a lot about direct assignment to variables from
within a regular expressions, but has decided this isn't the real
problem - the real problem is that people want to build up structures of
anonymous hashes or arrays from a regular expression.

There will be set operations on characters classes: for instance, you'll
be able to specify a match of all letters without the vowels. Actually,
this will probably be in Perl 5 as well. There was also time to tell us
that he'd like the `/x` modifier to be on by default.

The next talk was about subroutines. Prototypes will be extended into a
complete type signature system; the sub keyword would be discarded on
closures - in fact, any curly braces which are not immediately
recognisable will be assumed to be a closure. Parameters to closures
will be "self-identifying", such as `$^a` and `$^b`.

Larry said that formats would be a module, so he didn't have to say
anything more about it.

The reference talk opened to the statement that pseudo-hashes must die;
there was loud applause. Larry reiterated that dereferences will be
assumed when a scalar is followed by braces - that is to say, what is
now `$foo->[$a]` will be reduced to `$foo[$a]` in Perl 6. This will
require prohibiting whitespace before hash subscripts.

In terms of data types, there will be compact arrays; pseudo-hashes will
be replaced by opaque objects with named parameters. The `=>` operator
will now create a pair type; the range operators will create a slightly
different type of pair, which gets expanded out to a range on demand.

There will be a distinction between classes and modules. Within a class
or a module, there will be subpackages: there will be no more need to
type out `Myclass::SubclassA::SubclassB`; just like Unix has relative
pathnames and directories, Perl will have modules that can be specified
as relative namespaces.

On the theme of modules, module names would be extended to include
metadata on the version and the author's name. The default `use`
statement would allow the version and author's name to be wildcards.
There will also be virtual interface modules, and better automation of
documentation based on module metadata.

Objects should be easy to declare and have accessible metadata. When you
put an attribute onto the module, it will appear as a variable inside of
the class; outside of the class, it can be accessed as a method. There
will also be optional multimethods, and syntax like `Class.bless($ref)`
to bless a reference into a class.

### Addressing Concerns

Larry mentioned that overloading was a headache; you hate it in
languages that have it, and you hate it when languages don't have it.
Sometimes there are gratuitous abuses of overloading, such as C++'s
left-shift operator to add more arguments to a function. The overloading
system will be a lot cleaner, by specifying operators as special method
names. The vtable system will be leveraged to provide overloading on
objects. There will also be overloading hooks in `printf` so that new
formats can be defined.

Larry said that many of the proposals about tied variables missed the
point; what is tied is the variable, and not the value. Tying needs to
be naturally scoped to the variable's lifetime, and tying needs to be
declared in advance for efficiency.

He also begged for compassion towards programmers when dealing with
Unicode; we don't want to force people to have to deal with Unicode if
they don't want to, and equally we don't want to leave Unicode people
out in the cold. Strings need to be completely polymorphic, with
internal routines able to specify what type of strings they're able to
cope with. Normalization will normally be done at the filehandle level,
and the type system must remember whether or not some data has been
normalized.

The IPC talk asked for "no pain" installation of new protocols; there
will be easy mapping of high-level structured data, such as XML-RPC or
SOAP, from the network onto Perl's internal data structures. Perl 6 will
continue to have safe signals. IPv6 will be supported.

The thread model will basically be ithreads, the new model in 5.6.0;
variables may be shared by declaration, but will not be shared by
default. The Pthread model will mean "share everything". Modules ought
to be thread safe by default - they should declare their thread-safety
or otherwise in their metadata.

Perl will have a parser of its own, written in Perl. This will allow us
to bytecompile the parser, and also have the parser modifiable. It'll
also help us port `eval` to Perl running on small virtual machines.
Lexical analysis will remain as a one-pass process, and subroutines will
be compiled immediately on parsing.

The command line interface will not dramatically change; only one RFC
concerned it. Larry stressed Perl's role as a glue language, and that it
must cooperate with its environment.

Larry also had a shameful confession; he wrote the Perl debugger, but
hardly ever uses it - he's more a `print`-statement kinda guy. Hence,
he's happy to delegate the writing of the debugger to other people. He
did, however, point out the heavy dependency a debugger has on the
debugging facilities of the platform it runs on.

He's also punting on the internals, leaving the details of that to Dan
Sugalski, who's talking tomorrow. However, he said that the internals
will be much more modular; they will comprise a software CPU, and
regular expressions will compile down to normal Perl opcodes. It will
implement a variety of garbage collection models, and will use vtables
to despatch operations on values.

### What about CPAN?

CPAN got too big to download, and there's a problem that ISPs never
install enough of it for what their users want. Bundles are a partial
solution to this, but of late there has been more interest in the
development of an SDK for Perl.

Tainting will be implemented by the new property method, and sandboxing
will be achieved by using separate interpreter threads.

Perl 6 will attempt to remove some common goofs: Perl 5 has already
stopped taking up huge quantities of memory when you say
`foreach $i (1 .. 1_000_000_000) { ... }`;, but Perl 6 will also apply
the same optimization to `@big = 1 .. 1_000_000_000;`. There'll also be
support for embedding your tests in POD.

Speaking of POD, `=begin` and `=end` will work for commenting because
now `=end` will go back to the previous state rather than going to POD.
Larry wants multiple POD streams, noting that the DATA filehandle is
essentially just another POD stream.

Perl culture has been mostly self-correcting; the Perl 6 announcement
drove people to work together more strongly and fix up some of the flaws
of the community. However, Larry encouraged everyone to do their part;
newbie friendliness is one thing, but it's important to hold yourself to
higher standards than those to which you hold yourself.

The cleanup of special variables will be an exercise in balancing
cleanup with convenience. For instance `$_` will obviously be staying;
`$(`, on the other hand, will go. This allows us to free up `$( ... )`
for interpolating expressions. Bareword filehandles will go, and error
status variables may be merged.

Built-in functions. For functions with terribly long return lists, such
as `stat`, Perl will return modules; some subset of the proposed array
operators (`merge`, `partition`, `flatten`, etc.) will be included in
the core. The logical return values from functions such as `system` will
be made more sensible; `select` will be removed.

The standard Perl library will be almost entirely removed. The point of
this is to force ISPs to believe that Perl is essentially useless on its
own, and hence they will **need** to install additional modlues.
Pragmatic modules will have more freedom to warp Perl's syntax and
semantics, and will also provide real optimization hints.

Larry suggested that the standard module library could be downloaded
basically on demand; there will be a few modules which support basic
built-in functionality and their documentation. Perl 6 should deal with
I18N and L10N issues, and also support the sort of exception handling
that you would expect from languages of its type.

### "There are 35 seconds left. Any questions?"

So that's the rudiments of the design of Perl 6. Over the coming months,
we'll see the rest of the Apocalypses, backed up by Exegeses from
Damian, and hopefully, eventually, code from Dan and the rest of the
team. We'll bring you our analysis of how the Perl 6 language is shaping
up when we all get home from the conference!
