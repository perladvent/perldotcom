##### [RealAudio Version](/media/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/onion.ram)

\

Thank you very much. I like you too. Especially when you likeme like
you're liking me right now. Thank you for liking me. And thank you for
your applause. I confess, I'm human--I like applause. I like attention.

Speaking of attention, how many of you saw the August 10 issue of Forbes
magazine? Wait, my daughter made me something. *&lt;dons orange
glasses&gt;*

*\[laughter\]*

Anyway, I like applause. So let's talk about applause. Applause is
primarily an auditory or audio symbol. Like any symbol, it seems kind of
silly if you think about it too much. I mean, come on, why in the world
are you sitting there banging your hands together? Your palms probably
hurt now. And you're gonna get arthritis when your older. Clapping is
silly.

However, it makes a great noise, doesn't it? That's the point. Other
people hear you clapping and they may decide to clap too. It's something
a crowd can agree on. It is, in short, a symbol that ties a community
together. Most symbols work that way.

I love auditory symbols. If you've ever visited my house, you know that
my house is full of them. So last year I filled my keynote speech with
all sorts of weird sounds. The sound-oriented folks in the crowd loved
it, but the visually-oriented folks felt a bit left out. So this year
I've decided to concentrate on the sights rather than the sounds. Sort
of a WYSIWYG. What you see is what you get. Maybe next year we'll do
smellovision. We can compare the smell of a camel to the smell of a
rose.

Or maybe we can't...

But this year it's pictures. So here's my first figure.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/2.gif)

Study it carefully.

In case you were wondering what this is, it's called a circle. It's a
very nice circle, as circles go. Very pretty. Very symmetrical. Very
simple.

Now if you're a reductionist, you'll say it's *only* a circle, and
nothing more. Well, actually, if you're *really* a reductionist, you'll
say it's a just bunch of photons, but we won't go there, because it
wouldn't shed any light on the subject.

Sorry.

Well, actually, I'm not.

If you're *not* a reductionist, then the circle you see here does not
exist in isolation. It exists in relationship to many other things, and
in fact takes its meaning from them. In order to understand this simple
circle, you have to understand its context, which means you have to
understand something about reality.

So here's a picture of reality.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/3.gif)

As we all know, reality is a mess.

This is a picture of many things. It's a picture of air molecules
bouncing around. It's a picture of the economy. It's a picture of all
the relationships of the people in this room. It's a picture of what the
typical human language looks like. It's a picture of your company's
information systems. It's a picture of the World Wide Web. It's a
picture of chaos, and of complexity.

I hope it's not a picture of how well my talk is organized.

It's certainly a picture of how Perl is organized, since Perl is modeled
on human languages. And the reason human languages are complex is
because they have to deal with reality.

We all have to deal with reality one way or another. So we simplify.
Often we oversimplify.

Our ancestors oversimplified. They fooled themselves into thinking that
God only created circles and spheres. They thought God would always
prefer simplicity over complexity. When they discovered that reality was
more complicated than they thought, they just swept the complexity under
a carpet of epicycles. That is, they created *unnecessary* complexity.
This is an important point. The universe is complex, but it's usefully
complex.

Evidence abounds that people continue to oversimplify today. Some people
prefer to oversimplify their cosmology. Others prefer to oversimply
their theology. Many computer language designers oversimplify their
languages, and end up sweeping the universe's complexity under the
carpet of the programmer.

I would name names, but I might get in trouble with some of my friends.
Some of my best friends are language designers.

It's a natural human trait to look for patterns in the noise, but when
we look for those patterns, sometimes we see patterns that aren't really
there. But that doesn't mean there aren't real patterns. If we can find
a magic wand to suppress the noise, then the signal pops right out.
Abracadabra...

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/4.gif)

Here is the shape of the big bang, and of stars, and of soap bubbles.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/5.gif)

Here is the shape of dimensionality, of salt crystals, and the spaces
between trees trunks.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/6.gif)

Here is the shape of an anthill, or a Christmas tree. Or the shape of a
trinity.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/7.gif)

And, of course, once you know the patterns are there, you can pick out
the simple figures without the extra chromatic help.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/8.gif)

Our brains are built to do that.

Now, you may be wondering what all this has to do with Perl. The fact
is, your brains are built to do Perl programming. You have a deep desire
to turn the complex into the simple, and Perl is just another tool to
help you do that--just as I am using English right now to try to
simplify reality. I can use English for that because English is a mess.

This is important, and a little hard to understand. English is useful
*because* it's a mess. Since English is a mess, it maps well onto the
problem space, which is also a mess, which we call reality. Similarly,
Perl was designed to be a mess (though in the nicest of possible ways).

This is counterintuitive, so let me explain. If you've been educated as
any kind of an engineer, it has been pounded into your skull that great
engineering is simple engineering. We are taught to admire suspension
bridges more than railroad trestles. We are taught to value simplicity
and beauty. That's nice. I like circles too.

However, complexity is not always the enemy. What's important is not
simplicity or complexity, but how you bridge the two.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/9.gif)

You need a certain amount of complexity to do any particular job. A
Saturn V rocket is said to have had seven million parts, all of which
had to work. But that's not entirely true. Many of those parts were
redundant. But that redundancy was absolutely necessary to achieve the
goal of putting someone on the moon in 1969. So if some of those rocket
parts had the job of being redundant, then each of those parts still had
to do their part. So to speak. They also serve who only stand and wait.

We betray ourselves when we say "That's redundant", meaning "That's
useless." Redundancy is not always "redundant", whether you're talking
about rockets or human languages or computer languages. In short,
simplicity is often the enemy of success.

Suppose I want to take over the world. *\[laughter\]* Not hard to
imagine, eh? Simplicity says I should just take over the world by
myself. But the reality of the situation is that I need your help to
take over the world, and you're all very complex. I actually consider
that a feature. Your relationships are even more complex. I *usually*
think of those as features. But sometimes they're bugs. We can debug
relationships, but it's always good policy to consider the people
themselves to be features. People get annoyed when you try to debug
them.

We mentioned that some complexity is useless, and some is useful. Here's
another example of useful complexity.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/10.gif)

Now, most of you sitting here are probably prejudiced in favor of
western writing systems, and so you think an ideographic writing system
is needlessly complex. You may even be thinking that this picture is as
complicated as the previous one. But again, it's a kind of engineering
tradeoff. In this case, the Chinese have traded learnability for
portability. Does that sound familiar?

Chinese is not, in fact, a single language. It's about five major
languages, any of which are mutually unintelligible. And yet, you can
write Chinese in one language and read it in another. Now that's what I
call a portable language. By choosing a higher level of abstraction, the
Chinese writing system optimizes for communication rather than for
simplicity. We have a billion people in China who can't all talk to each
other, but at least they can pass notes to each other.

Computers also like to pass notes to each other. Only we call it
networking.

A lot of my thinking this year has been influenced by working with
Unicode and with XML. Ten years ago, Perl was good at text processing.
It's even better at it now, for the old definition of text. But the
definition of "text" has been changing out from under Perl over those
ten years.

You can blame it all on the internet. I do...

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/11.gif)

It seems that when you click buttons on your browser, it makes computers
want to pass notes to each other. And they want to pass these notes over
cultural boundaries. Just as you want to understand what pops up on your
screen, your computer wants to understand what it's *about* to pop up on
your screen, because, believe it or not, the computer would actually
like to do it right. Computers may be stupid, but they're always
obedient. Well, almost always.

That's where Unicode and XML come in. (Tim Bray is going to give a talk
later this week on XML, so I'll talk mostly about Unicode.) Unicode is
just a set of universal ideographs so that the world's computers can
pass notes around to each other, and have some chance of doing the right
thing with them. Some of the ideographs in Unicode happen to match up
with various national character sets such as ASCII, but nobody in the
world will ever learn all of those languages. Nobody is expecting you to
learn all those languages. That's not the point.

Here's the point. Last month I was working on my church's web page. Our
church has just started up a Chinese congregation, so our church now has
two names, one of which can be represented in ASCII, and one of which
cannot. Here's what the page looks like.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/wwwnlnc.jpg)

\[Here's the direct link to the [web page](http://www.nlnc.org), which
will look better and load faster, but may not show the Chinese
characters in your browser.\]

If your browser is fairly recent, and if you have a Unicode font loaded,
then this is what you see. There's something important I want you to
notice here. (Besides the fact that I'm subliminally advertising my
church.)

If I'd done this a year ago, this block of Chinese characters would
probably have been a GIF image. But there's a problem with images. You
can't cut and paste characters from a GIF image. I've tried it often
enough to know, and I'm sure you have too. These chararacters can be
selected as characters. *&lt;demonstrates&gt;* They can be processed as
text. Text processing. You may have heard of text processing...

In fact, what you're looking at here is my very first CGI script. I'll
bet you showed off your first CGI script too.

Since some browsers don't support Unicode yet, I had to detect whether
the browser supports Unicode, because if it doesn't, these characters
splatter garbage all over the page. Garbage is usually construed as
useless complexity.

Anyway, back to simplicity.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/12.gif)

Let's do circles for a while.

We use circles to represent many things. Our circle of friends. A hug,
when written on the back of an envelope. The circle of a wedding ring,
which stands for unending love.

Proceeding from the sublime to the ridiculous, we also have the round
file, which is a kind of hell for dead paperwork.

Spheres of light. Black holes. Or at least their event horizons.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/13.gif)

One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/14.gif)

Crystal balls. Pearls.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/15.gif)

Onions. Pearl onions.

Here's the real title of this talk.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/16.gif)

Circles figure heavily in our symbology. And in particular, by adding
various appertenances to circles, we sometimes represent some rather
complicated notions with simple symbols. These symbols are the bridges
between simplicity and complexity.

Here's a real Zen diagram.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/17.gif)

Well, actually, it's not. In actual fact, the yinyang comes from the
Tao, or Dao if you can't pronounce an unaspirated 't'. The Tao is an
ancient oriental philosophy, and predates Zen by more than a millenium.
But hey, what's a thousand years among friends? Now that's what I call a
real millenium bug...

Anyway, back to yins and yangs.

The yinyang represents a dualistic philosophy, much like The Force in
Star Wars. You know, how is The Force like duct tape? Answer: it has a
light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together. I'm not a
dualist myself, because I believe the light is stronger than the
darkness. Nevertheless, the concept of balanced forces is useful at
times, especially to engineers. When an engineer wants to balance
forces, and wants them to stay balanced, he reaches for the duct tape.

Hmm. A roll of duct tape is also a circle. Must be symbolic, somehow.

When I made this yinyang, I wondered whether I was doing it right. It'd
be a shame to get it backwards, or sideways, or something.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/19.gif)

Well, you know, sometimes that sort of thing matters. It matters a lot
to organic chemists, who call it chirality--if you take a molecule of
spearmint flavor and flip it left for right, you end up with a molecule
of caraway flavor. Yuck. I used to think I hated rye bread, till I
discovered it was the caraway seeds they put in that I didn't like. Hmm.
Now that's an idea. Spearmint flavored rye bread. Mmm. Hey, I just said
it was an idea. I didn't say it was a *good* idea.

Now, which of those flavors you prefer is just a matter of taste, but
doctors and organic chemists will tell you that there are times when
chirality is a matter of life and death. Or of deformed limbs, in the
case of Thalidomide. It was the "wrong" kind of Thalidomide that
actually caused the problems. Dyslexics will tell you that chirality
matters a lot in visual symbols. This talk is brought to you by the
letters letters 'b' and 'd'. And 'p' and 'q'. And the number 6. Not to
mention the number 9. You can see a 6 and a 9 in the yinyang, in this
orientation. Um. I'm not going to take that analogy any further.

Anyway. In short, I wondered whether the yinyang is like a swastika,
where which way you make it determines who gets mad at you.

So I did some research. On the Web, of course. Big mistake...

The fact is, the Web is the perfect example of TMTOWDTI. There's more
than one way to do it. In this case, there's every way to do it. You can
find the yinyang in every possible orientation. I still don't know
whether any of them is righter than the others.

A TYEDYE WORLD is some folks on the Web who sell tie-dyed tee shirts. I
guess they'd be Tao-dyed in this case. They think it looks like this.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/20.gif)

I suppose if you want it the other way you just put the shirt on
inside-out. Putting it on upside-down is going to get you stared at.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/21.gif)

The folks at the the Unicode consortium think it looks like this. I
don't know if they're right, but if they're not, it doesn't matter. They
published it this way, and now it's right by definition.

Of course, my dictionary has it upside from that...

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/22.gif)

I even found someone with a rotating version, but I'm not into cute
little animations yet, so I'm not gonna inflict it on you. (You may
clap.)

Well, back to Unicode. Unicode is full of circles. Many national scripts
within Unicode make use of the circle, and in most of those, it
represents the digit 0. Here is Unicode number 3007 (hex). It's the
ideographic symbol for 0.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/23.gif)

Surprise, surprise. It looks like our 0. Chalk one up for cultural
imperialism. In English, of course, we tend to squish our 0 sideways to
distinguish it from the letter O.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/24.gif)

In Bengali, they squish it the other way, but for similar reasons.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/25.gif)

I find it interesting that the world has so many different
representations for nothing. One could make endless jokes on it: Much
ado about nothing, or Nothing can stop an idea whose time has come. But
I can't really think of anything profound to say about zero, so let's
keep moving. Nothing is holding us back. Nevermind, pretend I said
nothing.

Here's something related to nothing.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/26.gif)

This is the universal "prohibited" symbol. In Unicode, it's classified
as a combining character. So I guess you can only prohibit other Unicode
characters. Actually, they just defined an object replacement character,
which could represent something like one of those cute little GIF
animations, so I guess we could prohibit almost anything that way.

Of course, in Perl culture, almost nothing is prohibited. My feeling is
that the rest of the world already has plenty of perfectly good
prohibitions, so why invent more? That applies not just to programming,
but also to interpersonal relationships, by the way. I have upon more
than one occasion been requested to eject someone from the Perl
community, generally for being offensive in some fashion or other. So
far I have consistently refused. I believe this is the right policy. At
least, it's worked so far, on a practical level. Either the offensive
person has left eventually of their own accord, or they've settled down
and learned to deal with others more constructively. It's odd. People
understand instinctively that the best way for computer programs to
communicate with each other is for each of the them to be strict in what
they emit, and liberal in what they accept. The odd thing is that people
themselves are not willing to be strict in how they speak, and liberal
in how they listen. You'd think that would also be obvious. Instead,
we're taught to express ourselves.

Bleaoghgh%\$%\$\#@!!!

You may feel much better afterwards, but consider the poor guy next to
you with the ruptured eardrum. Ruptured eardrums should be prohibited.

On the other hand, we try to encourage certain virtues in the Perl
community. As the apostle Paul points out, nobody makes laws against
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, meekness or
self-control. So rather than concentrating on forbidding evil, let's
concentrate on promoting good. Here's the Unicode for that.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/27.gif)

Of course, if you're a flower child, you might prefer this one.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/28.gif)

Some of the positive Unicodes aren't so obvious.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/29.gif)

Here's the symbol for a bilabial click, one of the symbols in the
Internation Phonetic Alphabet. You may not know it, but many of you make
this noise regularly. If you want to try doing one, here's how. You just
kind of put your lips together, then make an affricated sort of noise
with ingressive mouth air, like this: *&lt;demonstrates kiss&gt;*

Of course, in English we write that with an X, to go with those O's on
the back of the envelope. But you're witnessing the passing of an era.
What with email taking over, sending hugs and kisses on the backs of
envelopes is becoming a lost art. It just doesn't have quite the same
effect as a header line in email. Content-type: text/hugs&kisses.

You know, it's also rather difficult to perfume an email message.
Content-type: text/scented. The mind boggles. Ah well, save it for my
talk next year on smellovision.

Here are more simple circles that represent complicated things. Here's
the symbol for earth.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/30.gif)

Here's the symbol for Mars.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/31.gif)

And here's the symbol for Venus.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/32.gif)

Now, I used to work at JPL, and I helped just a little to discover that
Mars and Venus are pretty complicated. But as if things weren't
complicated enough, the ancients complicated things further by
overloading those symbols to represent male and female. Men are from
Mars, Women are from Venus, we are told, but that is not a new idea. And
we're not here to talk about sex, fun though that may be.

Here's some more history.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/33.gif)

If you cut an onion, it looks like this. If we take this to be a picture
of the world of Perl, then I must be that little bit of onion inside.
Around me are some of the early adopters of Perl, who are now revered as
heroes of the revolution. As more people have joined the movement, new
layers have been added. You can also picture this as an atom, with
layers of electron shells. Of course, no atom we know of has quite that
many electron shells. So stick with the onion.

Now the thing about the onion is that it teaches me something about my
own importance. Or lack thereof. Namely, that while I may have started
all this, I'm still a little bit of the onion. Most of the mass is in
the outer layers. (That's why I like to see grassroots movements like
the Perl Mongers springing up.) But here I sit in the middle. I get a
bit of honor for my historical significance, and you sit here patiently
listening to me talk about the oddest things, but in actual fact, most
people see the outside of the onion, not the inside. Unless they make
onion rings. But even then, the bigger rings have more to them than the
smaller rings. Let that be a lesson to those of you who wish to be
"inner ringers". That's not where the real power is. Not in this
movement, anyway. I've tried to model the Perl movement on another
movement I'm a member of, and the founder of that movement said, "He who
wishes to be greatest among you must become the servant of all." Of his
twelve inner ringers, one betrayed him, and 10 of the other 11 went on
to suffer a martyr's death. Not that I'm asking any of my friends to
throw themselves to the lions just yet.

But back to growth patterns. Natural pearls grow in layers too, around a
grain of sand that irritates the oyster in question, which forms layers
of pretty stuff. This could be the cross-section of a pearl. People cut
up onions frequently, but they almost never cut up pearls. So it's even
truer of pearls than of onions. The outer layer is the most important.
It's what people see. Or if the pearl is still growing, it's the layer
that will support the layer after it. I realize that that classifies me
as a mere irritant. I am content to be so classified.

Other things grow over time too. Perhaps if we change the picture to a
set of tree rings, it'll be clearer.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/34.gif)

If you're familiar with a bit of physics, you know that a pipe is almost
as strong as a solid bar of the same diameter, because most of the force
is transmitted in the outer layers. The fact is, the center of the tree
can rot, but the tree remains perfectly healthy. In a similar fashion,
most of the health of Perl culture is in what is happening in the
periphery, not in the center. People are saving themselves billions of
dollars every year by programming in Perl, but most of those savings are
happening out in the trenches. Even closer into the center, a lot more
work is going into hooking Perl up to other things than into changing
Perl itself. And I think this is as it should be. Core Perl is
stabilizing somewhat. Even with core changes such as multi-threading and
Unicode support, we pretend that we're adding extension modules, because
that's cleaner, and people don't have to invoke the new functionality if
they don't want to.

All this stuff about growth rings is fine for talking about the past,
but what about the future? I don't have a crystal ball. I do own two
pairs of binoculars. Here's the typical symbol for that.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/35.gif)

This is, of course, the usual cinematic device for indicating that
someone is looking through binoculars. I don't know offhand what I
should put for the field of view here, so let's see what's at the other
end of the binoculars.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/36.gif)

As an aside here, I should point out that the xeyes program has a
special meaning for me this year, because I had a cornea transplant in
January, and have been seeing in stereoscopic vision for the first time
in twelve years. I could give a whole talk on perspective, and on how we
see things. Well, actually, I'm already doing that. But let me tell you
that every time I see a circle, I think of that little circle of cornea
that someone gave me. It's one of those gifts you can't repay. That's my
private symbolism for the circle.

Well, back to xeyes here. The fun thing to do with xeyes, of course, is
to resize them. I kinda like the flat version.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/37.gif)

Don't let Forbes Magazine get ahold of your xeyes, or they're colorize
them.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/38.gif)

Anyway, I was thinking about these various shapes for this talk, and it
suddenly occurred to me that this is a picture of two tidally locked
bodies rotating around each other.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/39.gif)

Each of these planets is raising tides on the other one. People usually
understand why there is a tidal bulge on the side facing the other
planet. What they don't understand so easily is why there's a bulge on
the other side of the planet. But it makes sense when you consider that
the other planet is not only pulling the near bulge away from the center
of the planet, but it's also pulling the center of the planet away from
the far bulge.

This is a really good picture of the relationship of the free software
community with the commercial software community. We might even label
some of the extremes. Let's just make up some names. We could call the
left extreme, um, "Richard".

And we could call the right extreme something like, oh, "Bill".

The middle bulges are a little harder to name, but just for today we can
call this one on the middle left, "Larry", and that one on the middle
right, "Tim". But of course, you can supply your own names, since I just
picked these names at random.

This is, of course, another oversimplification, because various people
and organizations aren't at a single spot in the diagram, but tend to
rattle around. Some people manage to oscillate back and forth from one
bulge to the other. One moment they're in favor of more cooperation
between the freeware and commercial communities, and the next moment
they're vilifying anything commercial. At least our hypothetical Richard
and Bill are consistent.

But the action is in the middle.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/40.gif)

That's where everybody's been looking, to see what's going to happen. In
fact, this is really last year's picture. This year it looks more like
this.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/41.gif)

Robert L. Forward has written a book, actually a series of books, about
a place called Rocheworld. It's named after a fellow named Roche,
surprise, surprise. He's the fellow that defined Roche's limit, which
predicted that planets would break up if they got too close to each
other. It turns out he oversimplified because his math wasn't powerful
enough. If you allow your planets to deform into shapes like these, you
can get them very much closer together, and keep them stable. Mind you,
the net gravitational pull on these points is very low, but it's enough
to keep the planets together.

In similar fashion, the freeware and commercial communities are much
closer together this year than many people thought possible by the old
calculations. In Rocheworld, the planets did not touch, but they shared
atmospheres. If we fuzz things out a little with the magic of xpaint,
then we kind of get the picture.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/42.gif)

You see how you can fly from one planet to the other, but not walk. It's
reminscent of quantum mechanical tunneling, where you can't get from
here to there but you do it anyway with a flying leap.

What we have flowing between the freeware and commercial communities is
a lot of ideas. Together, these two inner lobes define what we're now
calling the Open Source movement. What we have here is something brand
new: former enemies agreeing on a common good that transcends any
particular business model. And that common good is better software
sooner. Most of you have probably read the Cathedral and the Bazaar by
now. So maybe I'm preaching to the choir here. But I thought you'd like
the picture.

Speaking of pictures, you know this also looks like a pair of bacteria
conjugating. You realize that if the Internet had been founded by
bacteria, this would be considered pornographic material. I'm not sure
why my talk keeps coming back to the subject of sex, but in actual fact,
that interchange of useful information is the sort of relationship we're
discussing here, regardless of how you label the picture. This is just
plain sexy stuff.

On a more practical note, I will show you what made it all possible.
People realized the power of a simple idea. We don't need software
patents or trade secrets. All we need another simple circle.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/43.gif)

A circle with a 'c' in it. Open Source lives or dies on copyright law.
Our fond hope is that it lives. Please, let's all do our part to keep it
that way. If you have a chance to plug copyrights over patents, please
do so. I know many of you are already plugging copyrights over trade
secrets. Let's also uphold copyright law by respecting the wishes of
copyright holders, whether or not they are spelled out to the
satisfaction of everyone's lawyer. The 'c' in the circle should stand
for civility.

When we think of civility, we think of cities, and of doing things fair
and square. So here's the requisite square.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/44.gif)

And indeed, cities are built on squares, and rectangles. We call them
blocks. And if the city planners leave the buildings off of a block, we
call it a square. Even if it isn't square. Go figure.

Sometimes the buildings themselves are square.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/45.gif)

But often they're not. Similarly, if you look through the Unicode book,
there are not nearly so many squares as there are circles. I think
there's a fundamental underlying reason for that. When we build
buildings, and when we write characters, we install them into a
rectilinear framework. In terms of writing, we write left-to-right, or
right-to-left, or top-to-bottom. The abstract cells into which we
install the characters or buildings are squarish. But both buildings and
characters tend to disappear visually if they follow the same lines as
the overall text. So most characters tend to contain lines at odd
angles, just as many modern skyscrapers are designed to avoid looking
like boxes. Nobody really likes the skyscrapers of the 1960's, because
they're too boxy. People like things to be visually distinct from their
surroundings.

That is also why the various classes of operators and variables in Perl
are visually distinct from each other. It's just sound human
engineering, as far as I'm concerned. I don't like the fact that all the
operators look the same in Lisp. I don't like the fact that most the
street signs look alike in Europe. And I applaud the decision of Germany
to make their stop signs look different from all the other signs. Of
course, it's also helpful to us ignorant Americans that they made them
look like American stop signs. Chalk up another one for cultural
imperialism.

However, in repentence for American cultural imperialism, let me tell
you about another advantage of the ideographic system of writing.
Because ideographs are written into square cells, they can just as
easily be written horizontally as vertically. Or vice versa. Our
variable-width characters do not have that nice property. Especially in
a font like Helvetica, where you have trouble telling i's and l's apart
even when they're next to each other. Put one above the other and it'd
just look like a dotted line. Chalk one up for the Chinese, the
Japanese, and the Koreans.

To wrap up, I'd like to talk about triangles. Here's a sample.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/46.gif)

Triangles are related to circles in the same way that arrowheads are
related to targets. Here's a target.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/47.gif)

I know I got this one right. I looked it up on the Web. More
importantly, I stopped as soon as I found the first one.

Actually, this is the Unicode character named "bullseye".

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/48.gif)

I'm not quite sure what it's supposed to mean. But that's never stopped
me before. I'll make it mean something.

I've shot a lot of arrows in this talk, and I don't know whether I've
hit any bullseyes yet. We put triangles on the front of arrows because
they're sharp. Triangles are associated with pain, especially if you
step on one. The angles of the triangle tend to suggest the hard work of
climbing a mountain.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/49.gif)

On the other hand, looks can be deceiving. A triangle also represents a
flat road stretching to the horizon.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/50.gif)

It's all a matter of perspective. You can choose your view by choosing
where to stand. I can't predict whether Perl's road ahead will be bumpy
or smooth, but I can predict that the more perspectives we can see
things from, the easier it will be to choose the perspectives we like.
And this is, after all, the job of a language designer, to survey the
problem from many perspectives, to be just a little bit omniscient, so
that other people can benefit. I do a little triangulation, and I map
the territory. That's my job. If my map gets you where you're going, I'm
happy.

If you take a section out of the Perl onion, it looks kind of like a
triangle. Put in on its side and you have a growth chart for Perl over
the last ten years.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/51.gif)

All fine and dandy. This chart is notional, of course. I have no way of
measuring Perl's actual growth. But obviously it is still growing. We're
doing a lot of things right, and by and large we should keep doing just
what we're doing.

Now suppose we shrink this triangle and extend the chart to show the
whole lifetime of Perl. We really don't know how long it might last.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/52.gif)

It's hard to say what will make the difference here. But I have to tell
you that I don't evaluate the success of Perl in terms of how many
people like me. When I integrate these curves, I count the number of
people I've helped get their job done.

I can tell you that I think the difference between the red curve and the
yellow curve might depend on adding in all the potential Windows users,
and all the problems they need to solve. Which are many. It's no
accident that we've just put out a Win32 Perl Resource Kit.

And I can tell you that the difference between the yellow curve and the
green curve may depend on adding in all the international users that
could benefit from Perl. It's no accident that the latest development
version of Perl lets you name your variables with any characters that
are considered to be alphanumeric in Unicode. That includes ideographs.
There are a billion people in China. And I want them to be able to pass
notes to each other written in Perl. I want them to be able to write
poetry in Perl.

That is my vision of the future. My chosen perspective.

Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are
three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/53.gif)

These are virtues of passion. They are not, however, virtues of
community. The virtues of community sound like their opposites:
diligence, patience, and humility.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/54.gif)

They're not really opposites, because you can do them all at the same
time. It's another matter of perspective. These are the virtues that
have brought us this far. These are the virtues that will carry our
community into the future, if we do not abandon them.

Basically, we just have to stay the course. Friedrich Nietzsche called
it "a long obedience in the same direction", which is a good snappy
slogan. But I like the full quote too:

> The essential thing "in heaven and earth" is ... that there should be
> long obedience in the same direction; there thereby results, and has
> always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth
> living.

And now we've come full circle, back to the circle. Here is the front
door of Bilbo Baggins' house. There's a road that goes from that door,
and Bilbo wrote a poem about it.

![](/images/_pub_1998_08_show_onion/55.gif)

>     The Road goes ever on and on,
>     Down from the door where it began.
>     Now far ahead the Road has gone,
>     And I must follow, if I can,
>     Pursuing it with eager feet,
>     Until it joins some larger way
>     Where many paths and errands meet.
>     And whither then?  I cannot say.

Thank you all for sharing the Road with me.
