Whoa! Deja vu! Where'd Matt go?

Don't worry, Matt's still writing summaries. As you may have noticed,
Matt's been writing summaries every two weeks. Now so am I. Because we
love you, we've decided to arrange things so I write summaries in the
weeks when Matt doesn't. We could do it the other way, but that some
could see as self-defeating. Heck, when I say "some" I probably mean
"all."

So bear with me while I remember how to type all those accented
characters and get back into the swing of writing these things (and of
reading everything in the mailing lists once more--someone should write
a summary for us summarizers).

I'll be sticking to my old "lists in alphabetical order" scheme of
writing summaries. Let's get going.

### This Week in *perl6-compiler*

#### [Array of Arrays, Hash of Hashes, Elems, Last](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=6.2.0.14.2.20050405083226.02fbc8a8@pop.pipeline.com)

Lev Selector asked for confirmation that Pugs didn't support compound
data structures, `@ar.elems`, or `@ar.last`. Autrijus and others
confirmed that they didn't then, but they do now.

#### [MakeMaker6 Stalls on Takeoff](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=p06210202be7926b05de8@%5B192.168.1.102%5D)

Darren Duncan pointed out that while last week's summary had claimed he
was working on implementing MakeMaker in Perl 6, this is, sadly, not the
case. He reckoned he'd possibly look into it again when he had tuits and
Pugs was more complete (supporting objects, for instance).

#### [Declaration Oddness](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=200504072344.18631.roiem@actcom.co.il)

Roie Marianer pointed out what looks like some weirdness in Pugs'
parsing of lexically scoped subroutines. Warnock applies.

#### [Toronto Pugs Hackathon](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050407174040.GA26479@lupus.perlwolf.com)

John Macdonald asked for people who wanted to come to the YAPC::NA Pugs
hackathon to get in touch with him beforehand, as there is limited
space. If you're interested, drop him a line.

#### [Pugs Slice Oddities](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050409104859.63926.qmail@web50803.mail.yahoo.com)

Andrew Savige noticed some weirdness in Pugs's slicing behavior. He
posted some example code showing the problem. Autrijus agreed that there
was a problem and explained that he was in the process of rewriting all
the variable types, symbol tables, and casting rules to agree with the
Perl 5 model as described in *perltie.pod*. The rewrite is currently
failing tests, so he posted a patch for people who want to play. On
Sunday, he bit the bullet and committed the entire 2500-line patch which
"touches pretty much all evaluator code."

### Meanwhile, in *perl6-internals*

#### [Tcl, Unicode](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42534227.7000005@coleda.com)

William Coleda has been trying to add Unicode support to his Tcl
implementation and he fell across issues with missing methods in
*charset/unicode.h*. Leo waved a magic wand and checked in an
implementation that he fenced around with disclaimers.

#### [The Status of Ponie](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=cdcef3714478b9d9e45d6571b17ce460@fotango.com)

Nicholas Clark confessed that Ponie had stalled for some time, but
sweetened the pill by announcing that it's about to restart and that he
will be able to allocate at least one day a week to the project. He
pointed people at the [Ponie
intro/roadmap](http://opensource.fotango.com/software/ponie/plan) that
breaks down the required tasks between here and a first release,
complete with time estimates. If you're interested in getting Ponie to a
ridable state, this is a good place to start.

People were pleased.

#### [Monthly Release Schedule](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050406222449.GS12946@perlsupport.com)

Chip donned his "Fearless Leader" hat and announced that Parrot will
move to a monthly release schedule (with an initial three-week "month"
to get things into sync). There was some debate about whether
Solaris/SPARC should be one of the officially required monthly release
platforms (Darwin, `linux-x86-gcc3.*`, and `win32-ms-cl` were Chip's
initial blessed three). This morphed into a discussion of Tinderbox;
apparently there are cool things happening behind the scenes.

#### [Calling Convention Abstraction](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050407082131.24711.qmail@lists.develooper.com)

What do you know? You go away for *n* months and when you come back
people are *still* talking about calling conventions.

#### [Dynamic Perl, Part 1](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/54bef4c32fea8d8f/222d23c8b8d1f347)

William Coleda announced that he was starting work on removing the
core's dependence on `Perl*` PMCs in favor of using language-agnostic
PMCs internally and loading the Perl ones dynamically as required. He
dealt with everything but `PerlArray` quickly and the list discussed
names and ways forward with that tricky case. It looks like someone with
tuits needs to add and write tests for some `vtable` methods for
`ResizablePMCArray`.

#### [Subversion](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=m3oecqrlm4.wl_rs@pobox.com)

Another discussion that wouldn't go away back when I was last writing
summaries has come to a head. Parrot's finally migrating from CVS to
Subversion. By the time you read this, Parrot's main repository should
be at [svn.perl.org/parrot](http://svn.perl.org/parrot). Hurrah!

There were, of course, [wrinkles to iron
out](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=m34qeeqzzm.wl_rs@pobox.com).

-   [Getting started with subverted
    Parrot](http://www.parrotcode.org/source.html)

#### [The *imcc/* Subdirectory](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=198c873805041115575359f54c@mail.gmail.com)

Matt Diephouse wondered if, now that IMCC has been integrated with
Parrot, we really need the *imcc/* subdirectory. He suggested that maybe
its contents should be distributed about the rest of the Parrot
directory structure. MrJoltCola (Melvin Smith?) thought it was best kept
separate and thought of as a front end. Bernhard Schmalhofer pointed out
PAST, another Parrot front end, and suggested that it may make sense to
refactor *imcc/main.c* into (he suggests) *src/main.c* and
*imcc/frontend.c*, which would make the distinction rather clearer and
provide an opportunity to clean up the exported symbols. Leo pretty much
agreed with Melvin (no comment on Bernhard's suggestions yet, though).

#### [Perl Jobs for the Willing](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=425B900E.6050409@toetsch.at)

Leo looked for volunteers to rejig *t/src/manifest.t* to use
*.svn/Entries* instead of *CVS/Entries* when checking the *MANIFEST*.
Michael Schwern (possibly accidentally) volunteered.

### Meanwhile, in *perl6-language*

A quick note about notation: I've started borrowing notation from
Ruby/Smalltalk to discuss methods. Where I write `SomeClass#method`,
then I am referring to an instance method of `SomeClass` and where I
write `SomeClass.method`, I am referring to a class method.

#### [Identity Tests and Comparing Two References](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42517043.1080204@orthogon.com)

By heck, but I've not been keeping up.

I started understanding what was going on when people started talking
about implicit dereferencing of long chains of references. Larry's
saying that even if `$foo` is a reference to a reference to a reference
to a ... to "10," then `$$foo` will chase all the way along the
reference chain and evaluate to "10." The general response seemed to be,
"Wah! How do I make it not do that?"

[How to help
Larry](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050406183035.GB20211@wall.org)

#### [`say` What?](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050408060706.8683.qmail@web60801.mail.yahoo.com)

Ovid wondered if `say` (and `print`, come to that) should default to
printing the current topic. An initial hunt through the Perl 6 documents
proved to be "like trying to sip through a firehose," so he asked the
list (and dropped a heavy hint about indexing the docs).

According to Luke, it should default to the current topic.

#### [Blocks, Continuations, and `eval()`](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050408140311.GD21475@sci.fi)

Wolverian's been looking at the Perl 5 debugger and wondered if it would
be possible to add an `eval` method to objects that represent scopes.
The idea is that:

    $scope.eval 'say $foo'

would evaluate `say $foo` with all of `$scope`'s bindings, etc. in
place. (I wonder what `$scope.eval 'return'` would do.) At least, that's
what *I* think he meant. Others asked for clarification. Wolverian also
wanted to know how to get hold of a scope's continuation (or at least
the current continuation). Larry has in the past said that he wouldn't
expose continuations in the core language. Others have noted that it
wouldn't be beyond the bounds of possibility to write a Parrot-level
module which would expose them, though.

#### [Questions on `$pair.kv`](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=f773baa01367af7f6305d2d9624ae684@iinteractive.com)

Stevan Little had some questions about the behavior of the `Pair#kv`
method. Luke came through with the answer ("when all else fails,
consider the pair to be a one-element hash").

#### [Managing PLEAC](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050410030004.16112.qmail@web60805.mail.yahoo.com)

Prompted by a suggestion from Tim Bunce, Ovid started porting the
examples in the Perl Cookbook into [idiomatic Perl
6](http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/cookbook/). He asked for
comments and suggestions on how to proceed.

Marcus Adair proposed, and Luke Palmer strongly seconded, moving the
development of the code onto a mediawiki (wikipedia)-style Wiki that has
good support for "offline" discussion of code as it develops. Autrijus
reckoned that his current practice of handing out SVN committer bits to
anyone who expressed an interest and leaving discussion in the files
themselves seems to be working pretty well so far. He pointed at
[pugs.kwiki.org](http://pugs.kwiki.org/), though.

#### [Collaborative Synopses](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050410104626.GA11509@ttul.org)

Bryan Ingerson posted a preliminary cut of Synopsis 26 and asked for
comments. Yuval Kogman pointed out that the [*docs/* subdirectory of the
Pugs distribution](http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/) is filled with
documentation that needed proofreading and nitpicking. Go to it, people.

#### [Aliasing Swapped Values](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050410174751.88219.qmail@web60805.mail.yahoo.com)

Ovid wondered what:

    ($x,$y) := ($y, $x)

would do.

Juerd reckoned the answer is straightforward, and I must say I agree
with him.

#### [`String#chars` in a List Context](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=fb07797705041111035357ff89@mail.gmail.com)

Marcus Adair argued that it seems natural that `String#chars`, when used
in a list context, should return a list of the Unicode chars in the
string. Opinion seemed to favor the idea, but there's been no ruling
from Larry (or anyone else on the Design Team).

#### [Whither `use English`](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=200541194433.231936@GatewayM275)

David Vergin wondered if Perl 6 would have an equivalent of
`use English`, which will give sensible names to the various magic
globals (those that still exist, least). The answer: yes and no. There
will be no *English.pm* module, but the magic globals will all have
English names by default.

#### [Heredocs and Their Workings](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=fb07797705041117364d084d8e@mail.gmail.com)

Marcus Adair wondered about the use of Heredocs as positional
parameters. Luke confirmed that they should work just like they do in
Perl 5, modulo minor matters of spelling (now `qq::to/END/`, etc.) and
whitespace removal.

#### [Slicing Conflict](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050412063042.GA29831@navi.cx)

Luke pointed out that:

    my @a = (1,2,3,4);
    my @b = @a[1...];
    say +@b;

is potentially problematic (he argues it should print "3", but Perl 5
semantics imply that it should print "Inf"). He proposed breaking with
the Perl 5 way. Autrijus agreed with him and has implemented his
proposal in Pugs.
