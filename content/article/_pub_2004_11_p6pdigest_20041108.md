Welcome to yet another summary, brought to you (once again) with the aid
of the musical stylings of Dar Williams and Soul Coughing and a small,
stuffed elephant name Aliya. And, without further ado, I give you Perl 6
Language (whose traffic has picked up a little).

### Perl 6 Language

#### [What Was that Anonymous Thing?](http://xrl.us/dvi2)

Juerd wondered what things could be named and what could be anonymous.
Larry provided the answer: Subtypes, Enums, Lists (Lazy and Eager),
Grammars, and Packages, but then threatened to attack Juerd with hot
grits.

#### [Updated Apocalypses and Synopses](http://xrl.us/dvi3)

Larry proved links to the current versions of the various Apocalypses
and Synopses. Unfortunately he forgot to start a new thread with his
message....

-   [apocalypses](http://www.wall.org/~larry/apo)
-   [synopses](http://www.wall.org/~larry/syn)

#### [Suggested Warning for Overriding Operators](http://xrl.us/dvi4)

Aaron Sherman wanted to receive a warning for defining things like
`multi sub *infix:+(...) {...}`. But Larry reasoned that anyone who'd
use the `*` there does not care for warnings.

### Perl 6 Compiler

Last week, I bemoaned my lack of Google (and thus links). But a couple
kind souls pointed out that I could get links straight from the horses
mouth at [nntp.perl.org](http://nntp.perl.org/). All I can say is,
::shrug:: "Who knew that there was an Internet outside of Google?"
Fortunately, I do not have to admit to its existence as there were no
messages this week.

### Parrot Internals

#### [She-bangs for None!!](http://xrl.us/dvi5)

Last week James deBoer offered a patch to remove all of the shebang
lines from *config/\*.pl* (after his initial patch to add them to all of
them was turned away). Warnock applies.

#### Solaris 9 Troubles

Christian Aperghis-Tramoni has some trouble while trying to install on
Solaris 9. Warnock applies.

#### [More Vtables](http://xrl.us/dvi6)

Leo wanted to add a finalize vtable entry (in addition to destroy, which
is apparently used for free memory and not active resources). Jeff
commented on the difficulties implicit in finalizing stuff, and the
thread ran out of gas.

#### [Build Dynclasses by Default](http://xrl.us/dvi7)

Last week, Leo was stalling to hear about success and failures before
adding them to the default build. Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon and Sam Ruby
both chimed in with success. And so they did.

#### [Register Frame Recycling](http://xrl.us/dvi9)

Leo added in some basic continuation recycling. Dan didn't like that it
required the user to clone return continuations into full ones. Leo
agreed, but felt that a `returncc` function would be needed first. I
wondered why we needed this recycling and couldn't just let the DOD/GC
do it for us. The answer: speed.

#### [Upcase Binary Strings](http://xrl.us/dvja)

Dan wondered what should happen if you tried to play with the case of a
binary encoded string. The consensus seems to be either throw an
exception or nothing, depending on settings.

#### [Setref Poorly Named](http://xrl.us/dvjb)

Sam Ruby was initially confused by the strange behavior of setref. Leo
told him that it was intended to set a reference inside a reference type
and noted that classes needs a clean up. With the advent of dynclasses,
this sounds like a job for some adventurous lurker...

#### [Tracebacks PMC v. Ops](http://xrl.us/dvjc)

Leo wondered if we should have a PMC that could access the entire call
chain and do whatever evil it wanted. Dan conjectured that this sort of
thing was evil enough that ops might be well advised. Leo initially put
some methods into the continuation to do this, but later thought about
putting them into the interpreter instead. I like the interp idea.

#### [`Parrot -t` Memory Leaks](http://xrl.us/dvjd)

Last week our fearless leader notice some significant memory leaks with
`parrot -t`. This week our fearless pumpking fixed them.

#### [Performance Graphs](http://xrl.us/dvje)

Matt Diephouse (assisted by Joshua Gatcomb) provided a pointer to a page
of periodic Parrot performances, provided as pretty pictures. Please
provide possible improvement pointers.

#### [Uniline `yield()` and `return()`](http://xrl.us/dvjh)

Stéphane Payrard (whose name Google objects to strenuously) re-sent his
patch for uniline `yield` and `return` in PIR. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Mod\_parrot 0.1](http://xrl.us/dvji)

Jeff Horwitz released mod\_parrot 0.1. Pretty nifty.

[download mod\_parrot](http://xrl.us/dvjj)

#### [IO Auto-Flush Troubles](http://xrl.us/dvjk)

Christian Aperghis-Tramoni wondered how to make stdout not buffer away
his prompt. The answer (provided by Mary Pauley and Luke Palmer)
requires using `pioctl` and strange magic numbers.

#### [BigChanges--; release++?](http://xrl.us/dvjm)

Since the big indirect register change has gone through, some voices
suggested putting out a 0.1.2 release. Leo felt that it was too soon,
but seemed to be holding a minority opinion. I vote that we release
after the new register allocator (and possibly Dan's string stuff
depending on how long it takes).

#### [Dan's String Stuff](http://xrl.us/dvjn)

Dan is about to make some "Irrevocable Changes" so he decided to do his
work in a branch named `pluggable_encodings`, assuming he can use CVS
(which is surprisingly hard at times). Because no one screamed foul, I
think it is a safe assumption.

#### [Clone mmd](http://xrl.us/dvjo)

Sam Ruby submitted a patch adding `mmd_clone` for dynclasses. Leo
suggested an alternate approach, and Warnock\['s Dilemma\] took over.

#### [True Coroutines](http://xrl.us/dvjp)

Klaas-Jan Stol wondered if Parrot had "true" coroutine because Roberto
Ierusalimschy (of Lua fame) called it into question. Some confusion
ensued as to what the platonic ideal of a coroutine actually is, but the
answer seems to be: we should and if they aren't, patches welcome.

#### [Trouble with Closures and Subs](http://xrl.us/dvjq)

Klaas-Jan Stol was having trouble with closures and subs. Many people
provided some very useful pointers. If you are writing a compiler for
Parrot you should read this thread carefully. If you are writing a
summary for Parrot you should skim it and punt.

#### [Shared Library and Dynclasses](http://xrl.us/dvjr)

Sam Ruby wondered if dynclasses should link to *libparrot.so*. Dan
provided the answer: yes. Sam Ruby went on to suggest that if most PMCs
would eventually become dynclasses, then (to reduce executable size, the
Parrot executable should probably also link to *libparrot.so* rather
than including all of it. No one commented on this observation.

#### [Search Paths and Libraries](http://xrl.us/dvjs)

Dan wants to stop being annoyed by library path issues. He figures that
the right way to do this is to allow dynamic library loading. Best of
all he wants the code to do that be in the library. Thus he put out a
request for the ability to embed bytecode into an executable. Brent
"Dax" Royal-Gordon provided a slightly too-evil method of doing this.
Other slightly less-evil (or even good) options would definitely be
received thankfully.

#### [Benchmarks? Tests? Or Both?](http://xrl.us/dvjt)

Joshua Gatcomb noticed that some benchmarks fail on occassion. Matt
Diephouse suggested making them tests too. Leo felt that would be fine
provided they did not take too long to run.

#### [Fibonacci Still Slow](http://xrl.us/dvju)

It is odd how the wheel comes full circle. Originally designed as an
exercise in addition for students, the Fibonacci Sequence has some
really interesting mathematical properties. While completely ignoring
its unexpected niftiness (and explicit formula), this miraculous
sequence is still used as busy work for poor creatures. This time the
creature is Parrot, and despite Leo's best efforts, it is still slow.
There was some talk of how to optimize this before Dan put the smack
down all of it:

"No more performance changes. Period. We get Parrot fully functional
first."

#### [Parrot on Windows](http://xrl.us/dvjv)

Jerry Wiltz wondered how to get Parrot on his poor Win XP box. Fred and
Georgy provided many pointers. Christian Lott also had trouble, but
Nicholas Clark, Ron Blaschke, Peter Sinnott, and Steve Peters all
provided pointers.

#### [Parrot Build Issues](http://xrl.us/dvjx)

Jack J. Woehr was having trouble building parrot on his Sun. Leo
provided the needed help. Then ICU became problematic. Many people
provided help and he eventually got it running Forth, which promptly
segfaulted. Jack sounded discouraged, but he really should stay with it
now that he has overcome the hard part....

#### [Detecting *perldoc*](http://xrl.us/dvjz)

James deBoer wondered if we should detect the presence of perldoc and
fail to configure if it is missing. The consensus seems to be that we
should detect the absence of *perldoc*, but if it is not there throw up
a big fat warning and proceed.

#### [`Pow` and Other Ops](http://xrl.us/dvj2)

There was/is a fairly long and ongoing discussion about ops on PMCs,
which Sam Ruby unwittingly started when he asked for MMD `pow`. While
there are people on all sides, it appears likely that the ops will stay.

#### [C on Parrot?](http://xrl.us/dvj5)

Bloves wondered what the current state of C on Parrot was. But I think
he posted it through Google Groups (which does not actually reach the
list) as I did not find it in my email. The answer is it essentially
non-existent, but if you are feeling brave/insane/suicidal patches
welcome.

#### [Streams and Filters](http://xrl.us/dvj6)

Ron Blaschke tracked does the problem with *t/library/streams.t* \#14 on
Win32. The guilty party is line endings. One workaround would be to set
the file in question to binary in CVS (although that feels like
cheating).

#### [AIX PPC JIT](http://xrl.us/dvj7)

Adam Thomason provided a patch to fix some warnings. Leo applied it.

#### [Register Allocation/Volatility](http://xrl.us/dvj8)

Despite Dan's line-in-the-sand strong statements about no more
optimization, Jeff Clites and Leo tossed about some radical ideas for
how to speed everything up.

#### [GC Invocation](http://xrl.us/dvj9)

Leo suggested changing the GC from one that interrupts everybody and
does its thing, to one that waits its turn and does its thing. I am
concerned that this could lead to resource starvation in a multithreaded
system, but nobody else posted anything. Of course, he only suggested
this today.

#### [`Eval` Questions](http://xrl.us/dvka)

Leo wants some answers to some `eval` questions before he tries to clean
up dynamic code compiling. Answers??

#### [Include Perl 6 Files in Config](http://xrl.us/dvkb)

Gerd Pokorra wants to be able to run Perl 6 from anywhere. He even
provided a means of achieving this end (although not in unified diff
format as is the custom).

#### `pioctl` -&gt; segfault

Stéphane Payrard received a segfault while playing with the previously
mentioned `pioctl` magic numbers. Leo speculates that this might be due
to the lack of an `end` opcode.

#### [\[TODO\] Improve *parrot-config.imc*](http://xrl.us/dvkc)

Takers wanted.

#### [Missing Arguments](http://xrl.us/dvkd)

Klaas-Jan Stol wondered how to detect missing arguments. Leo and Dan
both pointed to the argument count registers.

#### [Update to *embed.pod*](http://xrl.us/dvke)

Stéphane Payrard provided an update to *embed.pod*. Leo applied it, but
Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon cried foul over the including of *parrot.h*.
Dan agreed with Brent, and Stéphane provided a patch to remove the
offending line.

#### [Calling Conventions, Tracebacks, and Register Allocations](http://xrl.us/dvkf)

Leo suggested a new way to invoke functions that would clean up calling,
tracebacks, and register allocation. While such a change would have
great aesthetic value, Dan declared it premature as Parrot is not yet
fully specified. Doubtless this will re-arise later, as aesthetics is a
powerful motivator.
