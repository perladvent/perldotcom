<br />

<p>The e-smith server and gateway system is a Linux distribution designed for 
small to medium enterprises. It's intended to simplify the process of 
setting up Internet and file-sharing services and can be administered by a 
non-technical user with no prior Linux experience. </p> <p>We chose Perl as the main development language for the e-smith server and 
gateway because of its widespread popularity (making it easier to recruit 
developers) and it's well suited to e-smith's blend of system 
administration, templating and Web-application development.</p> <p>Of course, the system isn't just Perl. Other parts of the system include the 
base operating system (based on Red Hat 7.0), a customized installer using Red 
Hat's Anaconda (which is written in Python), and a range of applications 
including mail and Web servers, file sharing, and Web-based e-mail using IMP 
(which is written in PHP). However, despite the modifications and quick hacks 
we've made in other languages, the bulk of development performed by the e-smith 
team is in Perl.</p> <h3><a name=aen16>The E-Smith Manager: a Perl CGI 
Application</a></h3> <p>Administration of an e-smith server and gateway system is performed primarily 
via a Web interface called the "e-smith manager." This is essentially a 
collection of CGI programs that display system information and allow the 
administrator to modify it as necessary.</p> <p>This allows system owners with no previous knowledge of Linux to administer 
their systems easily without the need to understand the arcana of the command 
line, text configuration files, and so on.</p> <div class=mediaobject> <p><img src="/pub/2001/02/perl-article-manager.jpg"></img></p></div> <p>The manager interface is based on the <code>CGI</code> module 
that comes standard with the Perl distribution. However, a module <code>esmith::cgi</code> has been written to provide further 
abstractions of common tasks such as:</p>  <ul> <li> generating page headers and footers
  <li> generating commonly used widgets
  <li> generating status report pages</li></ul> <p>It is likely that this module will be further extended in the next version to 
provide more abstract ways of building "wizard" style interfaces, so that 
developers don't have to copy and paste huge swathes of code calling the <code>CGI</code> module directly.</p></div>   <h3><a name=aen37>Global Configuration Files</a></h3> <p>The e-smith server and gateway is a collection of many parts, all of which 
can be configured in different ways depending on the user's needs. All the 
global configuration data is kept in a central repository and this information 
is used as the base for specific configurations for the various software on the 
system.</p> <p>Much of the system configuration data is kept in a simple text file, 

<code>/home/e-smith/configuration</code>. The basic format is name=value, 
as shown below:</p> <pre>AccessType=dedicated
ExternalDHCP=off
ExternalNetmask=255.255.255.0</pre> <p>Obviously, this can be simply parsed with Perl, by using something equivalent 
to:</p>  <pre>my %conf;
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    chomp;
    my ($name, $value) = split(/=/);
    $conf{$name} = $value;
}

print "$conf{DomainName}\n";</pre> <p>However, it is also possible to store more information in a single line by 
adding zero or more pairs of property names and values delimited by pipe symbols 
(<code>|</code>), like this:</p> <pre>fetchmail=service|status|enabled
flexbackup=backupservice|erase_rewind_only|true
ftp=service|access|private|status|enabled</pre> <p>Parsing this gets tricky, requiring an additional split and 
putting the property names and values into a hash. </p> <p>As it happens, e-smith has a module with common utilities such as this built 
in, so a developer would only write something like this:</p> <pre>use esmith::db;

my %conf;
tie %conf, 'esmith::config', '/home/e-smith/configuration';

my $domain = db_get(\%conf, 'DomainName');

my ($type, %properties) = db_get(\%conf, 'ftp');</pre> <p>Similar to the main configuration file, user and group information is kept 
in <code>/home/e-smith/accounts</code>, in a format that is also
simple to parse.</p> <p>This simplicity is intentional; although the data could have been stored in a 
more complex database, the developers decided to keep the core of e-smith as 
simple as possible so that the learning curve for new developers would not be 
steep.</p>  <h3><a name=aen54>Templated Configuration Files Using 
Text::Template</a></h3> <p>Things become more complex when we examine the configuration files stored in <code>/etc</code>. Each piece of software has its own configuration 
format, and writing parsers for each one can be a complex, time-consuming and 
error-prone process. The e-smith software avoids this by using a 
template-driven system instead, using <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&amp;amp;query=text::template" 
target=_top><code>Text::Template</code></a>.</p>  <p>Templates are stored in a directory hierarchy rooted at <code>/etc/e-smith/templates</code>. Each configuration file is either a 
<code>Text::Template</code> file or can be given a subdirectory in 
which template fragments are stored. These templates are then parsed (and in the 
case of a subdirectory of fragments, concatenated together) to generate the 
config files for each service on the system. The fragmented approach is part of 
e-smith's modular and extensible architecture; it allows third-party modules to 
add fragments to the configuration, if necessary.</p>  <p>For example, let's look at the <span class=application>ntpd</span> service (which keeps the system's clock right by querying a time server using 
the Network Time Protocol). It usually has a config file 
<code>/etc/ntp.conf</code>. On an e-smith server, this is built out of 
the template fragments found in the <code>/etc/e-smith/templates/etc/ntp.conf/</code> directory.</p>  <p>This is a simple template, and only requires basic variable substitutions. 
(Since <code>Text::Template</code> evaluates anything in braces and 
replaces it with the return value of the code, some templates have more complex 
code embedded within them.) Here is what is in the template fragment file 
<code>/etc/e-smith/templates/etc/ntp.conf/template-begin</code>:</p> <pre>Server { $NTPServer }
driftfile /etc/ntp/drift
authenticate no</pre> <p>In this example, <code>$NTPServer</code> would be replaced with the 
value of that variable.</p> <p>Instead of calling <code>Text::Template</code> directly, e-smith 
developers use the <code>e-smith::util</code> module to automate the 
process. Here's how we would generate the <code>ntp.conf</code> file:</p><pre>use esmith::util;

processTemplate({
    CONFREF =&gt; \%conf,  # this is the %conf from the last section
    TEMPLATE_PATH =&gt; '/etc/ntp.conf',
});</pre> <p>The above example takes advantage of a number of default values set by the 
<code>processTemplate()</code>. If we want more control, we can 
specify such things as the user ID (UID), group ID (GID) and permissions to use 
when writing the configuration file.</p> <pre>use esmith::util;

processTemplate({
    CONFREF =&gt; \%conf,  # this is the %conf from the last section
    TEMPLATE_PATH =&gt; '/etc/ntp.conf',
    UID =&gt; $username,
    GID =&gt; $group,
    PERMS =&gt; 0644,
});</pre> <p>Incidentally, the way in which the <code>processTemplate()</code> routine lets the programmer override the default values is a good example of 
Perlish idiom:</p><pre># the parameter hash the programmer passed to the routine is

my %p = (�faults, %params_hash);

</pre> <h3><a name=aen84>Events and Actions</a></h3> <p>When the user hits "submit" on a Web form, a number of things can occur:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> master configuration files are updated
  <li> templated configuration files in /etc are updated
  <li> network services restarted
  <li> new user account created
  <li> backup performed
  <li> ... or any of a number of other events.</li></ul> <p>The model used to make these things happen is one of actions and events. An 
event is something that happens on the system (such as the user submitting a Web 
form, an installation completing, a reboot, etc). An action is the atomic unit 
of things-that-need-doing, several of which may be called when an event occurs. 
For instance, the <code>post-install</code> event calls actions to 
configure and start various services, initialize the password file, and so 
on.</p> <p>Actions are written as Perl scripts, and stored in <code>/etc/e-smith/events/actions</code>. Some of them just use 
<code>system()</code> calls to do what's needed, as in this example (
<code>/etc/e-smith/events/actions/reboot</code>):</p><pre>package esmith;

use strict;
use Errno;

exec ("/sbin/shutdown", qw(-r now)) or die "Can't exec shutdown: $!";
exit (2);</pre> <p>Others are more complex and can contain as many as a few hundred lines of Perl 
code.</p> <p>An event is defined by creating a subdirectory under <code>/etc/e-smith/events</code> and filling it with symlinks to the 
actions to be performed.</p> <pre>[root@e-smith events]# ls -l user-create/
total 0

lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           21 Jan 24 00:07 S80pptpd-conf -&gt; ../actions/pptpd-conf</pre> <p>Events are called via a script called <code>/sbin/e-smith/signal-event</code>, itself written in Perl. It's 
included here nearly in full, as a detailed example of e-smith code.</p><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

package esmith;
use strict;


my $event = $ARGV [0];
my $handlerDir = "/etc/e-smith/events/$event";


opendir (DIR, $handlerDir)
    || die "Can't open directory /etc/e-smith/events/$event\n";

my @handlers = sort (grep (!/^\.\.?$/, readdir (DIR)));

closedir (DIR);


open (LOG, "|/usr/bin/logger -i -t e-smith");


my $ofh = select (LOG);
$| = 1;
select ($ofh);

print LOG "Processing event: @ARGV\n";


my $exitcode = 0;
my $handler;
foreach $handler (@handlers)
{
    my $filename = "$handlerDir/$handler";
    if (-f $filename)
    {
 print LOG "Running event handler: $filename\n";
 print LOG `$filename @ARGV 2&gt;&amp;1`;
 if ($? != 0)
 {   
     $exitcode = 1;
 }
    } 
}

close LOG;
exit ($exitcode);</pre>  <h3><a name=aen114>Future Development</a></h3> <p>There is currently a locking issue with the global configuration files. The 
techniques used to manipulate these files do not allow multiple processes to 
modify them concurrently. If two programs try to manipulate the files at the 
same time, one of them will overwrite the other's changes. This is obviously 
a serious issue, albeit one that seldom causes problems in normal use, as most 
e-smith servers do not have multiple administrators working on the system at the 
same time.</p> <p>A seemingly obvious solution is to use DBM instead of the current flat-text 
file system. However, the flat-text files are important because they make the 
system config readable and modifiable using a standard text editor from the 
Linux shell prompt. A simple command can then regenerate other configs or stop 
or start services based on the changes, without requiring the Web interface to 
be used. This is useful in the situation when the Web interface might have 
been broken (a rare situation) or when a configuration option is hidden from 
less technical users.</p> <p>A solution combining the benefits of text files and DBM has been suggested, 
in which the routine that reads the config database would check to see whether 
the text file has been changed recently. If it has been changed, it would convert it to 
DBM, otherwise it would just use the DBM directly. When a configuration option 
is changed, it would be written to both the DBM and the text file.</p> <p>Another problem is the way that multiple instances of the Perl interpreter 
are invoked to run events and actions, causing some performance problems. A 
number of alternatives are being considered, including <a 
href="http://perl.apache.org/" target=_top>mod_perl</a> and <a 
href="http://poe.perl.org/" target=_top>POE</a>. The goal is to reduce the wait 
experienced by the user when they click "submit" via the Web interface; 
ideally, response should be near-instantaneous.</p> <p>Other forthcoming improvements include a simpler way to create "wizard" 
interfaces for the e-smith manager (possibly using the <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/formmagick/" target=_top>FormMagick</a> Perl module currently under development), and internationalisation (probably 
using the <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&amp;amp;query=Locale::Maketext" 
target=_top>Locale::Maketext</a> module).</p>  <h3><a name=aen125>In Conclusion ...</a></h3> <p>The e-smith server and gateway is a great example of a large project using 
Perl both as a system administration scripting tool and a Serious Programming 
Language. Although it has about 20,000 lines of Perl code, the system 
is easy to understand and the Perl code is maintainable and readable, 
even by relatively inexperienced Perl programmers.</p> <p>If you're interested in taking a closer look at the e-smith code, or maybe 
contributing to it, more information is available from the <a 
href="http://www.e-smith.org/" target=_top>e-smith developer 
Web site</a>.</p>
