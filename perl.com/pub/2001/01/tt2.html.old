<h3><a name="introducing the template toolkit">Introducing the Template Toolkit</a></h3>

<p>There are a number of Perl modules that are universally recognised as The
Right Thing To Use for certain tasks. If you accessed a database without
using DBI, pulled data from the WWW without using on of the LWP modules
or parsed XML without using XML::Parser or one of its subclasses then you'd
run the risk of being shunned by polite Perl society.</p>

<p>I believe that the year 2000 saw the emergence of another 'must have'
Perl module - the Template Toolkit. I don't think I'm alone in this 
belief as the Template Toolkit won the 'Best New Module' award at the
Perl Conference last summer. Version 2.0 of the Template Toolkit
(known as TT2 to its friends) was recently released to the CPAN.</p>

<p>TT2 was designed and written by Andy Wardley &lt;<a href="mailto:abw@cre.canon.co.uk">abw@cre.canon.co.uk</a>&gt;. It was 
born out of Andy's previous templating module, Text::Metatext, in best Fred 
Brooks 'plan to throw one away' manner; and aims to be the most useful (or, 
at least, the most <em>used</em>) Perl templating system.</p>
<p>TT2 provides a way to take a file of fixed boilerplate text (the template) 
and embed variable data within it. One obvious use of this is in the creation 
of dynamic web pages and this is where a lot of the attention that TT2 has
received has been focussed. In this article, I hope to demonstrate that
TT2 is just as useful in non-web applications.</p>

<h3><a name="using the template toolkit">Using the Template Toolkit</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at how we'd use TT2 to process a simple data file. TT2 is an
object oriented Perl module. Having downloaded it from CPAN and installed 
it in the usual manner, using it in your program is as easy as putting the 
lines</p>
<pre>
    use Template;</pre>
<pre>
    my $tt = Template-&gt;new;</pre>
<p>in your code. The constructor function, <code>new</code>, takes a number of optional
parameters which are documented in the copious manual pages that come with 
the module, but for the purposes of this article we'll keep things as
simple as possible.</p>
<p>To process the template, you would call the <code>process</code> method like this</p>
<pre>
    $tt-&gt;process('my_template', \%data)
      || die $tt-&gt;error;</pre>
<p>We pass two parameters to <code>process</code>, the first is the name of the file
containing the template to process (in this case, my_template) and the 
second is a reference to a hash which contains the data items that you
want to use in the template. If processing the template gives  any kind 
of error, the program will die with a (hopefully) useful error message.</p>
<p>So what kinds of things can go in <code>%data</code>? The answer is just about
anything. Here's an example showing data about English Premier League
football teams.</p>
<pre>
    my @teams = ({ name =&gt; 'Man Utd',
                   played =&gt; 16,
                   won =&gt; 12,
                   drawn =&gt; 3,
                   lost =&gt; 1 },
                 { name =&gt; 'Bradford',
                   played =&gt; 16,
                   won =&gt; 2,
                   drawn =&gt; 5,
                   lost =&gt; 9 });</pre>
<pre>
    my %data = ( name =&gt; 'English Premier League',
                 season =&gt; '2000/01',
                 teams =&gt; \@teams );</pre>
<p>This creates three data items which can be accessed within the template,
called <code>name</code>, <code>season</code> and <code>teams</code>. Notice that <code>teams</code> is a complex
data structure.</p>
<p>Here is a template that we might use to process this data.</p>
<pre>
    League Standings</pre>
<pre>
    League Name: [% name %]
    Season     : [% season %]</pre>
<pre>
    Teams:
    [% FOREACH team = teams -%]
    [% team.name %] [% team.played -%] 
     [% team.won %] [% team.drawn %] [% team.lost %]
    [% END %]</pre>
<p>Running this template with this data gives us the following output</p>
<pre>
    League Standings</pre>
<pre>
    League Name: English Premier League
    Season     : 2000/01</pre>
<pre>
    Teams:
    Man Utd 16 12 3 1
    Bradford 16 2 5 9</pre>
<p>Hopefully the syntax of the template is simple enough to follow. There are
a few points to note.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Template processing directives are written using a simple language which
is not Perl.
</li>
<li>
The keys of the <code>%data</code> have become the names of the data variables within
the template.
</li>
<li>
Template processing directives are surrounded by <code>[%</code> and <code>%]</code> 
sequences.
</li>
<li>
If these tags are replaced with <code>[%-</code> <code>-%]</code> then the preceding or 
following linefeed is suppressed.
</li>
<li>
In the <code>FOREACH</code> loop, each element of the <code>teams</code> list was assigned,
in turn, to the temporary variable <code>team</code>.
</li>
<li>
Each item assigned to the <code>team</code> variable is a Perl hash. Individual
values within the hash are accessed using a dot notation.
</li></ul>

<p>It's probably the first and last of these points which are the most
important. The first point emphasises the separation of the data 
acquisition logic from the presentation logic. The person creating
the presentation template doesn't need to know Perl, they only need
to know the data items which will be passed into the template.</p>

<p>The last point demonstrates the way that TT2 protects the template
designer from the implementation of the data structures. The data objects
passed to the template processor can be scalars, arrays, hashes, objects
or even subroutines. The template processor will just interpret your
data correctly and Do The Right Thing to return the correct value to
you. In this example each team was a hash, but in a larger system
each team might be an object, in which case <code>name</code>, <code>played</code>, etc. would
be accessor methods to the underlying object attributes. No changes would
be required to the template as the template processor would realise that
it needed to call methods rather than access hash values.</p>

<h3><a name="a more complex example">A more complex example</a></h3>

<p>Stats about the English Football League are usually presented in a slightly
more complex format that the one we used above. A full set of stats will
show the number of games that a team has won, lost or drawn, the number
of goals scored for and against the team and the number of points that
the team therefore has. Teams gain three points for a win and one point
for a draw. When teams have the same number of points they are separated
by the goal difference, that is the number of goals the team has scored
minus the number of team scored against them. To complicate things
even further, the games won, drawn and lost and the goals for and 
against are often split between home and away games.</p>
<p>Therefore if you have a data source which lists the team name togther with
the games won, drawn and lost and the goals for and against split into
home and away (a total of eleven data items) you can calculate all of the
other items (goal difference, points awarded and even position in the 
league). Let's take such a file, but we'll only look at the top three 
teams. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre>
  Man Utd,7,1,0,26,4,5,2,1,15,6
  Arsenal,7,1,0,17,4,2,3,3,7,9
  Leicester,4,3,1,10,8,4,2,2,7,4</pre>
<p>A simple script to read this data into an array of hashes will look
something like this (I've simplified the names of the data columns -
w, d, and l are games won, drawn and lost and f and a are goals scored
for and against; h and a at the front of a data item name indicates
whether it's a home or away statistic):</p>
<pre>
  my @cols = qw(name hw hd hl hf ha aw ad al af aa);</pre>
<pre>
  my @teams;
  while (&lt;&gt;) {
    chomp;</pre>
<pre>
    my %team;</pre>
<pre>
    @team{@cols} = split /,/;</pre>
<pre>
    push @teams, \%team;
  }</pre>
<p>We can then go thru the teams again and calculate all of the derived
data items:</p>
<pre>
  foreach (@teams) {
    $_-&gt;{w} = $_-&gt;{hw} + $_-&gt;{aw};
    $_-&gt;{d} = $_-&gt;{hd} + $_-&gt;{ad};
    $_-&gt;{l} = $_-&gt;{hl} + $_-&gt;{al};</pre>
<pre>
    $_-&gt;{pl} = $_-&gt;{w} + $_-&gt;{d} + $_-&gt;{l};
</pre>
<pre>

    $_-&gt;{f} = $_-&gt;{hf} + $_-&gt;{af};
    $_-&gt;{a} = $_-&gt;{ha} + $_-&gt;{aa};</pre>
<pre>
    $_-&gt;{gd} = $_-&gt;{f} - $_-&gt;{a};</pre>
<pre>
    $_-&gt;{pt} = (3 * $_-&gt;{w}) + $_-&gt;{d};
  }</pre>
<p>And then produce a list sorted in descending order:</p>
<pre>
  @teams 
    = sort { $b-&gt;{pt} &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;{pt}
             || $b-&gt;{gd} &lt;=&gt; $a-&gt;{gd} } @teams;</pre>
<p>And finally add the league position data item:</p>
<pre>
  $teams[$_]-&gt;{pos} = $_ + 1 
    foreach 0 .. $#teams;</pre>
<p>Having pulled all of our data into an internal data structure we can start
to produce output using out templates. A template to create a CSV file 
containing the data split between home and away stats would look like this:</p>
<pre>
  [% FOREACH team = teams -%]
  [% team.pos %],[% team.name %],[% team.pl %],[% team.hw %],
  [%- team.hd %],[% team.hl %],[% team.hf %],[% team.ha %],
  [%- team.aw %],[% team.ad %],[% team.al %],[% team.af %],
  [%- team.aa %],[% team.gd %],[% team.pt %]
  [%- END %]</pre>
<p>And processing it like this:</p>
<pre>
  $tt-&gt;process('split.tt', { teams =&gt; \@teams }, 'split.csv')
    || die $tt-&gt;error;</pre>
<p>produces the following output:</p>
<pre>
  1,Man Utd,16,7,1,0,26,4,5,2,1,15,6,31,39
  2,Arsenal,16,7,1,0,17,4,2,3,3,7,9,11,31
  3,Leicester,16,4,3,1,10,8,4,2,2,7,4,5,29</pre>
<p>Notice that we've introduced the third parameter to <code>process</code>. If this
parameter is missing then the TT2 sends its output to <code>STDOUT</code>. If this
parameter is a scalar then it is taken as the name of a file to write the
output to. This parameter can also be (amongst other things) a filehandle
or a reference to an object which is assumed to implement a <code>print</code>
method.</p>
<p>If we weren't interested in the split between home and away games, then
we could use a simpler template like this:</p>
<pre>
  [% FOREACH team = teams -%]
  [% team.pos %],[% team.name %],[% team.pl %],[% team.w %],
  [%- team.d %],[% team.l %],[% team.f %],[% team.a %],
  [%- team.aa %],[% team.gd %],[% team.pt %]
  [% END -%]</pre>
<p>Which would produce output like this:</p>
<pre>
  1,Man Utd,16,12,3,1,41,10,6,31,39
  2,Arsenal,16,9,4,3,24,13,9,11,31
  3,Leicester,16,8,5,3,17,12,4,5,29</pre>

<h3><a name="producing xml">Producing XML</a></h3>
<p>This is starting to show some of the power and flexibility of TT2, but
you may be thinking that you could just as easily produce this output
with a <code>foreach</code> loop and a couple of <code>print</code> statements in your code.
This is, of course, true; but that's because I've chosen a deliberately
simple example to explain the concepts. What if we wanted to produce 
an XML file containing the data? And what if (as I mentioned earlier)
the league data was held in an object? The code would then look even
easier as most of the code we've written earlier would be hidden away 
in <code>FootballLeague.pm</code>.</p>
<pre>
  use FootballLeague;
  use Template;</pre>
<pre>
  my $league = FootballLeague-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'English Premier');</pre>
<pre>
  my $tt = Template-&gt;new;</pre>
<pre>
  $tt-&gt;process('league_xml.tt', { league =&gt; $league })
    || die $tt-&gt;error;</pre>
<p>And the template in <code>league_xml.tt</code> would look something like this:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE LEAGUE SYSTEM &quot;league.dtd&quot;&gt;</pre>
<pre>
  &lt;league name=&quot;[% league.name %]&quot; season=&quot;[% league.season %]&quot;&gt;
  [% FOREACH team = league.teams -%]
    &lt;team name=&quot;[% team.name %]&quot;
          pos=&quot;[% team.pos %]&quot;
          played=&quot;[% team.pl %]&quot;
          goal_diff=&quot;[% team.gd %]&quot;
          points=&quot;[% team.pt %]&quot;&gt;
       &lt;stats type=&quot;home&quot;&gt;
              win=&quot;[% team.hw %]&quot;
              draw=&quot;[%- team.hd %]&quot;
              lose=&quot;[% team.hl %]&quot;
              for=&quot;[% team.hf %]&quot;
              against=&quot;[% team.ha %]&quot; /&gt;
       &lt;stats type=&quot;away&quot;&gt;
              win=&quot;[% team.aw %]&quot;
              draw=&quot;[%- team.ad %]&quot;
              lose=&quot;[% team.al %]&quot;
              for=&quot;[% team.af %]&quot;
              against=&quot;[% team.aa %]&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/team&gt;
  [% END -%]
  &lt;/league&gt;</pre>
<p>Notice that as we've passed the whole object into <code>process</code> then we
need to put an extra level of indirection on our template variables
- everything is now a component of the <code>league</code> variable. Other 
than that, everything in the template is very similar to what we've
used before. Presumably now <code>team.name</code> calls an accessor function 
rather than carrying out a hash lookup, but all of this is transparent
to our template designer.</p>

<h3><a name="multiple formats">Multiple Formats</a></h3>
<p>As a final example, let's suppose that we need to create out football
league tables in a number of formats. Perhaps we are passing this
data on to other people and they can't all use the same format.
Some of our users need CSV files and others need XML. Some require
data split between home and away matches and other just want the
totals. In total, then, we'll need four different templates, but the
good news is that they can use the same data object. All the script
needs to do is to establish which template is required and process
it.</p>
<pre>
  use FootballLeague;
  use Template;</pre>
<pre>
  my ($name, $type, $stats) = @_;</pre>
<pre>
  my $league = FootballLeague-&gt;new(name =&gt; $name);</pre>
<pre>
  my $tt = Template-&gt;new;</pre>
<pre>
  $tt-&gt;process(&quot;league_${type}_$stats.tt&quot;, 
               { league =&gt; $league }
               &quot;league_$stats.$type&quot;)
    || die $tt-&gt;error;</pre>
<p>For example, calling this script as</p>
<pre>
  league.pl 'English Premier' xml split</pre>
<p>This will process a template called <code>league_xml_split.tt</code> and put the 
results in a file called <code>league_split.xml</code>.</p>
<p>This starts to show the true strength of the Template Toolkit. If we
later wanted to add another file format - perhaps we wanted to create
a league table HTML page or even a LaTeX document - then we would just 
need to create the appropriate template and name it according to our
existing naming convention. We would need to make no changes to the 
code.</p>
<p>I hope you can now see why the Template Toolkit is fast becoming
an essential part of many people's Perl installation.</p>
