<!-- 2nd State of the Onion -->
<BR><h5><A HREF="/1998/08/show/onion.ram">RealAudio Version</A></h5>
<!::field::id-author::><BR><P>Thank you very much.  I like you too.  Especially when you likeme like you're liking me right now.  Thank you for liking me.
And thank you for your applause.  I confess, I'm human--I like
applause.  I like attention.
<p>
Speaking of attention,
how many of you saw the August 10 issue of Forbes magazine?  Wait, my
daughter made me something. <i>&lt;dons orange glasses&gt;</i>
<p>
<em>[laughter]</em>
<p>
Anyway, I like applause.  So let's talk about applause.  Applause is
primarily an auditory or audio symbol.  Like any symbol, it
seems kind of silly if you think about it too much.  I mean,
come on, why in the world are you sitting there banging your
hands together?  Your palms probably hurt now.  And you're
gonna get arthritis when your older.  Clapping is silly.
<p>
However, it makes a great noise, doesn't it?  That's the point.
Other people hear you clapping and they may decide to clap too.
It's something a crowd can agree on.  It is, in short, a symbol
that ties a community together.  Most symbols work that way.
<p>
I love auditory symbols. If you've ever visited my house, you know
that my house is full of them.  So last year
I filled my keynote speech with all sorts of weird sounds.  The
sound-oriented folks in the crowd loved it, but the
visually-oriented folks felt a bit left out.  So this
year I've decided to concentrate on the sights rather than
the sounds.  Sort of a WYSIWYG.  What you see is what you get.
Maybe next year we'll do smellovision.  We can compare the smell
of a camel to the smell of a rose.
<p>
Or maybe we can't...
<p>

But this year it's pictures.  So here's my first figure.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/2.gif">
<P>
Study it carefully.
<p>
In case you were wondering what this is, it's called a circle.
It's a very nice circle, as circles go.  Very pretty.  Very
symmetrical.  Very simple.
<p>
Now if you're a reductionist, you'll say it's <em>only</em> a circle,
and nothing more.  Well, actually, if you're <em>really</em> a
reductionist, you'll say it's a just bunch of photons, but we
won't go there, because it wouldn't shed any light on the
subject.
<p>
Sorry.
<p>
Well, actually, I'm not.
<p>
If you're <em>not</em> a reductionist, then the circle you see
here does not exist in isolation.  It exists in relationship to
many other things, and in fact takes its meaning from them.  In
order to understand this simple circle, you have to understand
its context, which means you have to understand something about
reality.
<p>
So here's a picture of reality.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/3.gif">
<p>
As we all know, reality is a mess.
<p>
This is a picture of many things.  It's a picture of air
molecules bouncing around.  It's a picture of the economy.  It's
a picture of all the relationships of the people in this room.
It's a picture of what the typical human language looks like.
It's a picture of your company's information systems.  It's a
picture of the World Wide Web.  It's a picture of chaos, and of
complexity.
<p>
I hope it's not a picture of how well my talk is organized.
<p>
It's certainly a picture of how Perl is organized, since Perl is
modeled on human languages.  And the reason human languages are
complex is because they have to deal with reality.
<p>
We all have to deal with reality one way or another.  So we
simplify.  Often we oversimplify.
<p>
Our ancestors oversimplified.  They fooled themselves into
thinking that God only created circles and spheres.  They thought
God would always prefer simplicity over complexity.  When they
discovered that reality was more complicated than they thought,
they just swept the complexity under a carpet of epicycles.  That
is, they created <em>unnecessary</em> complexity.  This is an important
point.  The universe is complex, but it's usefully complex.
<p>
Evidence abounds that people continue to oversimplify today.
Some people prefer to oversimplify their cosmology.  Others
prefer to oversimply their theology.  Many computer language
designers oversimplify their languages, and end up sweeping the
universe's complexity under the carpet of the programmer.
<p>
I would name names, but I might get in trouble with some of my
friends.  Some of my best friends are language designers.
<p>
It's a natural human trait to look for patterns in the noise, but
when we look for those patterns, sometimes we see patterns that
aren't really there.  But that doesn't mean there aren't real
patterns.  If we can find a magic wand to suppress the noise,
then the signal pops right out.  Abracadabra...
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/4.gif">
<P>
Here is the shape of the big bang, and of stars, and of soap
bubbles.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/5.gif">
<P>
Here is the shape of dimensionality, of salt crystals, and the
spaces between trees trunks.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/6.gif">
<p>
Here is the shape of an anthill, or a Christmas tree.  Or the
shape of a trinity.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/7.gif"><p>
And, of course, once you know the patterns are there, you can
pick out the simple figures without the extra chromatic help.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/8.gif"><p>
Our brains are built to do that.
<p>
Now, you may be wondering what all this has to do with Perl.  The
fact is, your brains are built to do Perl programming.  You have
a deep desire to turn the complex into the simple, and Perl is
just another tool to help you do that--just as I am using
English right now to try to simplify reality.  I can use English
for that because English is a mess.
<p>
This is important, and a little hard to understand.  English is
useful <em>because</em> it's a mess.  Since English is a mess, it maps
well onto the problem space, which is also a mess, which we call
reality.  Similarly, Perl was designed to be a mess (though in
the nicest of possible ways).
<p>
This is counterintuitive, so let me explain.  If you've been
educated as any kind of an engineer, it has been pounded into
your skull that great engineering is simple engineering.  We
are taught to admire suspension bridges more than railroad
trestles.  We are taught to value simplicity and beauty.  That's
nice.  I like circles too.
<p>
However, complexity is not always the enemy.  What's important is
not simplicity or complexity, but how you bridge the two.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/9.gif"><p>
You need a certain amount of complexity to do any particular
job.  A Saturn V rocket is said to have had seven million parts,
all of which had to work.  But that's not entirely true.  Many of
those parts were redundant.  But that redundancy was absolutely
necessary to achieve the goal of putting someone on the moon in
1969.  So if some of those rocket parts had the job of being
redundant, then each of those parts still had to do their part.
So to speak.  They also serve who only stand and wait.
<p>
We betray ourselves when we say "That's redundant",
meaning "That's useless."  Redundancy is not always
"redundant", whether you're talking about rockets or human
languages or computer languages.  In short, simplicity is often
the enemy of success.
<p>
Suppose I want to take over the world.
<em>[laughter]</em>
Not hard to imagine, eh?
Simplicity says I should just take over the world by myself.  But
the reality of the situation is that I need your help to take
over the world, and you're all very complex.  I actually consider
that a feature.  Your relationships are even more complex.  I
<em>usually</em> think of those as features.  But sometimes they're
bugs.  We can debug relationships, but it's always good policy to
consider the people themselves to be features.  People get
annoyed when you try to debug them.
<p>
We mentioned that some complexity is useless, and some is
useful.  Here's another example of useful complexity.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/10.gif"><p>
Now, most of you sitting here are probably prejudiced in favor of
western writing systems, and so you think an ideographic writing
system is needlessly complex.  You may even be thinking that this
picture is as complicated as the previous one.  But again, it's a
kind of engineering tradeoff.  In this case, the Chinese have
traded learnability for portability.  Does that sound familiar?
<p>
Chinese is not, in fact, a single language.  It's about five
major languages, any of which are mutually unintelligible.  And
yet, you can write Chinese in one language and read it in
another.  Now that's what I call a portable language.  By
choosing a higher level of abstraction, the Chinese writing
system optimizes for communication rather than for simplicity.
We have a billion people in China who can't all talk to each
other, but at least they can pass notes to each other.
<p>
Computers also like to pass notes to each other.  Only we call it
networking.
<p>
A lot of my thinking this year has been influenced by working
with Unicode and with XML.  Ten years ago, Perl was good at text
processing.  It's even better at it now, for the old definition
of text.  But the definition of "text" has been changing out from
under Perl over those ten years.
<p>
You can blame it all on the internet.  I do...
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/11.gif"><p>
It seems that when you click buttons on your browser, it makes
computers want to pass notes to each other.  And they want to
pass these notes over cultural boundaries.  Just as you want to
understand what pops up on your screen, your computer wants to
understand what it's <em>about</em> to pop up on your screen, because,
believe it or not, the computer would actually like to do it
right.  Computers may be stupid, but they're always obedient.
Well, almost always.
<p>
That's where Unicode and XML come in.  (Tim Bray is going to give a talk
later this week on XML, so I'll talk mostly about Unicode.)
Unicode is just a set of
universal ideographs so that the world's computers can pass notes
around to each other, and have some chance of doing the right
thing with them.  Some of the ideographs in Unicode happen to
match up with various national character sets such as ASCII, but
nobody in the world will ever learn all of those languages.
Nobody is expecting you to learn all those languages.  That's not
the point.
<p>
Here's the point.  Last month I was working on my church's web
page.  Our church has just started up a Chinese congregation, so
our church now has two names, one of which can be represented in
ASCII, and one of which cannot.  Here's what the page looks
like. <P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/wwwnlnc.jpg">
<p>
[Here's the direct link to the
<a href="http://www.nlnc.org">web page</a>, which will look better and load
faster, but
may not show the Chinese characters in your browser.]
<p>
If your browser is fairly recent, and if you have a Unicode font
loaded, then this is what you see.  There's something important I
want you to notice here.  (Besides the fact that I'm subliminally
advertising my church.)
<p>
If I'd done this a year ago, this block of Chinese characters
would probably have been a GIF image.  But there's a problem with
images.  You can't cut and paste characters from a GIF image.
I've tried it often enough to know, and I'm sure you have too.
These chararacters can be selected as characters.
<i>&lt;demonstrates&gt;</i>
They can be
processed as text.  Text processing.  You may have heard of
text processing...
<p>
In fact, what you're looking at here is my very first CGI
script.  I'll bet you showed off your first CGI script too.
<p>
Since some browsers don't support Unicode yet, I had to detect
whether the browser supports Unicode, because if it doesn't,
these characters splatter garbage all over the page.  Garbage is
usually construed as useless complexity.
<p>
Anyway, back to simplicity.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/12.gif"><p>
Let's do circles for a while.
<p>
We use circles to represent many things.  Our circle of friends.
A hug, when written on the back of an envelope.  The circle of a
wedding ring, which stands for unending love.
<p>
Proceeding from the sublime to the ridiculous, we also have the
round file, which is a kind of hell for dead paperwork.
<p>
Spheres of light.  Black holes.  Or at least their event
horizons.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/13.gif"><p>
One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/14.gif"><p>
Crystal balls.  Pearls.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/15.gif"><p>
Onions.  Pearl onions.
<p>
Here's the real title of this talk.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/16.gif"><p>
Circles figure heavily in our symbology.  And in particular, by
adding various appertenances to circles, we sometimes represent
some rather complicated notions with simple symbols.  These
symbols are the bridges between simplicity and complexity.
<p>
Here's a real Zen diagram.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/17.gif"><p>
Well, actually, it's not.  In actual fact, the yinyang comes from
the Tao, or Dao if you can't pronounce an unaspirated 't'.  The Tao is
an ancient oriental philosophy, and predates Zen by
more than a millenium.  But hey, what's a thousand years among
friends?  Now that's what I call a real millenium bug...
<p>
<!--<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/18.gif"><p>-->
Anyway, back to yins and yangs.
<p>
The yinyang represents a dualistic philosophy, much like The
Force in Star Wars.  You know, how is The Force like duct tape?
Answer: it has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the
universe together.  I'm not a dualist myself, because I believe
the light is stronger than the darkness.  Nevertheless, the
concept of balanced forces is useful at times, especially to
engineers.  When an engineer wants to balance forces, and wants
them to stay balanced, he reaches for the duct tape.
<p>
Hmm.  A roll of duct tape is also a circle.  Must be symbolic,
somehow.
<p>
When I made this yinyang, I wondered whether I was doing it
right.  It'd be a shame to get it backwards, or sideways, or
something.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/19.gif"><p>
<p>
Well, you know, sometimes that sort of thing matters.  It
matters a lot to organic chemists, who call it chirality--if
you take a molecule of spearmint flavor and flip it left for
right, you end up with a molecule of caraway flavor.  Yuck.  I
used to think I hated rye bread, till I discovered it was the
caraway seeds they put in that I didn't like.  Hmm.  Now that's
an idea.  Spearmint flavored rye bread.  Mmm.  Hey, I just said
it was an idea.  I didn't say it was a <em>good</em> idea.
<p>
Now, which of those flavors you prefer is just a matter of taste,
but doctors and organic chemists will tell you that there are
times when chirality is a matter of life and death.  Or of
deformed limbs, in the case of Thalidomide.  It was the "wrong"
kind of Thalidomide that actually caused the problems.  Dyslexics will tell
you that chirality matters a lot in visual symbols.  This talk is
brought to you by the letters letters 'b' and 'd'.  And 'p' and
'q'.  And the number 6.  Not to mention the number 9.  You can
see a 6 and a 9 in the yinyang, in this orientation.  Um.  I'm
not going to take that analogy any further.
<p>
Anyway.  In short, I wondered whether the yinyang is like a
swastika, where which way you make it determines who gets mad at
you.
<p>
So I did some research.  On the Web, of course.  Big mistake...
<p>
The fact is, the Web is the perfect example of TMTOWDTI.  There's
more than one way to do it.  In this case, there's every way to
do it.  You can find the yinyang in every possible orientation.
I still don't know whether any of them is righter than the
others.
<p>
A TYEDYE WORLD is some folks on the Web who sell tie-dyed tee
shirts.  I guess they'd be Tao-dyed in this case.  They think it
looks like this.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/20.gif"><p>
I suppose if you want it the other way you just put the shirt on
inside-out.  Putting it on upside-down is going to get you stared
at.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/21.gif"><p>
The folks at the the Unicode consortium think it looks like
this.  I don't know if they're right, but if they're not, it
doesn't matter.  They published it this way, and now it's right
by definition.
<p>
Of course, my dictionary has it upside from that...
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/22.gif"><p>
I even found someone with a rotating version, but I'm not into
cute little animations yet, so I'm not gonna inflict it on you.
(You may clap.)
<p>
Well, back to Unicode.  Unicode is full of circles.  Many
national scripts within Unicode make use of the circle, and in
most of those, it represents the digit 0.  Here is Unicode
number 3007 (hex).  It's the ideographic symbol for 0.

<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/23.gif"><p>
Surprise, surprise.  It looks like our 0.  Chalk one up for
cultural imperialism.  In English, of course, we tend to squish
our 0 sideways to distinguish it from the letter O.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/24.gif"><p>
In Bengali, they squish it the other way, but for similar
reasons.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/25.gif">
<p>
I find it interesting that the world has so many different
representations for nothing.  One could make endless jokes on it:
Much ado about nothing, or Nothing can stop an idea whose time
has come.  But I can't really think of anything profound to say
about zero, so let's keep moving.  Nothing is holding us back.
Nevermind, pretend I said nothing.
<p>
Here's something related to nothing.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/26.gif"><p>
This is the universal "prohibited" symbol.  In Unicode, it's
classified as a combining character.  So I guess you can only
prohibit other Unicode characters.  Actually, they just defined
an object replacement character, which could represent something
like one of those cute little GIF animations, so I guess we could
prohibit almost anything that way.
<p>
Of course, in Perl culture, almost nothing is prohibited.  My
feeling is that the rest of the world already has plenty of
perfectly good prohibitions, so why invent more?  That applies
not just to programming, but also to interpersonal relationships,
by the way.  I have upon more than one occasion been requested to
eject someone from the Perl community, generally for being
offensive in some fashion or other.  So far I have consistently
refused.  I believe this is the right policy.  At least, it's
worked so far, on a practical level.  Either the offensive person
has left eventually of their own accord, or they've settled down
and learned to deal with others more constructively.  It's odd.
People understand instinctively that the best way for computer
programs to communicate with each other is for each of the them
to be strict in what they emit, and liberal in what they accept.
The odd thing is that people themselves are not willing to be
strict in how they speak, and liberal in how they listen.  You'd
think that would also be obvious.  Instead, we're taught to
express ourselves.
<p>
Bleaoghgh%$%$#@!!!
<p>
You may feel much better afterwards, but consider the poor guy
next to you with the ruptured eardrum.  Ruptured eardrums should
be prohibited.
<p>
On the other hand, we try to encourage certain virtues in the
Perl community.  As the apostle Paul points out, nobody makes
laws against love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
gentleness, meekness or self-control.  So rather than
concentrating on forbidding evil, let's concentrate on promoting
good.  Here's the Unicode for that.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/27.gif"><p>
Of course, if you're a flower child, you might prefer this one.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/28.gif"><p>
Some of the positive Unicodes aren't so obvious.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/29.gif"><p>
Here's the symbol for a bilabial click, one of the symbols in the
Internation Phonetic Alphabet.  You may not know it, but many of
you make this noise regularly.  If you want to try doing one,
here's how.  You just kind of put your lips together, then make an
affricated sort of noise with ingressive mouth air, like this:
<i>&lt;demonstrates kiss&gt;</i>
<p>
Of course, in English we write that with an X, to go with those
O's on the back of the envelope.  But you're witnessing the
passing of an era.  What with email taking over, sending hugs and
kisses on the backs of envelopes is becoming a lost art.  It just
doesn't have quite the same effect as a header line in email.
Content-type: text/hugs&kisses.
<p>
You know, it's also rather difficult to perfume an email
message.  Content-type:  text/scented.  The mind boggles.  Ah
well, save it for my talk next year on smellovision.
<p>
Here are more simple circles that represent complicated things.
Here's the symbol for earth.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/30.gif"><p>
Here's the symbol for Mars. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/31.gif"><p>
And here's the symbol for Venus. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/32.gif"><p>
Now, I used to work at JPL, and I helped just a little to
discover that Mars and Venus are pretty complicated.  But as if
things weren't complicated enough, the ancients complicated
things further by overloading those symbols to represent male and
female.  Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, we are told,
but that is not a new idea.  And we're not here to talk about
sex, fun though that may be.
<p>
Here's some more history.
<p>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/33.gif"><p>
If you cut an onion, it looks like this.  If we take this to be a
picture of the world of Perl, then I must be that little bit of
onion inside.  Around me are some of the early adopters of Perl,
who are now revered as heroes of the revolution.  As more people
have joined the movement, new layers have been added.  You can
also picture this as an atom, with layers of electron shells.  Of
course, no atom we know of has quite that many electron shells.
So stick with the onion.
<p>
Now the thing about the onion is that it teaches me something
about my own importance.  Or lack thereof.  Namely, that while I
may have started all this, I'm still a little bit of the onion.
Most of the mass is in the outer layers.  (That's why I like to
see grassroots movements like the Perl Mongers springing up.)
But here I sit in the middle.  I get a bit of honor
for my historical significance, and you sit here patiently
listening to me talk about the oddest things, but in actual fact,
most people see the outside of the onion, not the inside.  Unless
they make onion rings.  But even then, the bigger rings have more
to them than the smaller rings.  Let that be a lesson to those of
you who wish to be "inner ringers".  That's not where the real
power is.  Not in this movement, anyway.  I've tried to model
the Perl movement on another movement I'm a member of, and the
founder of that movement said, "He who wishes to be greatest
among you must become the servant of all."  Of his twelve inner
ringers, one betrayed him, and 10 of the other 11 went on to
suffer a martyr's death.  Not that I'm asking any of my friends
to throw themselves to the lions just yet.
<p>
But back to growth patterns.  Natural pearls grow in layers too,
around a grain of sand that irritates the oyster in question,
which forms layers of pretty stuff.  This could be the
cross-section of a pearl.  People cut up onions frequently, but
they almost never cut up pearls.  So it's even truer of pearls
than of onions.  The outer layer is the most important.  It's
what people see.  Or if the pearl is still growing, it's the
layer that will support the layer after it.  I realize that that
classifies me as a mere irritant.  I am content to be so
classified.
<p>
Other things grow over time too.  Perhaps if we change the
picture to a set of tree rings, it'll be clearer. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/34.gif"><p>
If you're familiar with a bit of physics, you know that a pipe is
almost as strong as a solid bar of the same diameter, because
most of the force is transmitted in the outer layers.  The fact
is, the center of the tree can rot, but the tree remains
perfectly healthy.  In a similar fashion, most of the health of
Perl culture is in what is happening in the periphery, not in the
center.  People are saving themselves billions of dollars every
year by programming in Perl, but most of those savings are
happening out in the trenches.  Even closer into the center, a
lot more work is going into hooking Perl up to other things than
into changing Perl itself.  And I think this is as it should be.
Core Perl is stabilizing somewhat.  Even with core changes such
as multi-threading and Unicode support, we pretend that we're
adding extension modules, because that's cleaner, and people
don't have to invoke the new functionality if they don't want
to.
<p>
All this stuff about growth rings is fine for talking about the
past, but what about the future?  I don't have a crystal ball.  I
do own two pairs of binoculars.  Here's the typical symbol for
that.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/35.gif"><p>
This is, of course, the usual cinematic device for indicating
that someone is looking through binoculars.  I don't know offhand
what I should put for the field of view here, so let's see what's
at the other end of the binoculars.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/36.gif"><p>
As an aside here, I should point out that the xeyes program has a
special meaning for me this year, because I had a cornea
transplant in January, and have been seeing in stereoscopic
vision for the first time in twelve years.  I could give a whole
talk on perspective, and on how we see things.  Well, actually,
I'm already doing that.  But let me tell you that every time I
see a circle, I think of that little circle of cornea that
someone gave me.  It's one of those gifts you can't repay.
That's my private symbolism for the circle.
<p>
Well, back to xeyes here.  The fun thing to do with xeyes, of
course, is to resize them.  I kinda like the flat version.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/37.gif"><p>
Don't let Forbes Magazine get ahold of your xeyes, or they're
colorize them. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/38.gif"><p>
Anyway, I was thinking about these various shapes for this talk,
and it suddenly occurred to me that this is a picture of two
tidally locked bodies rotating around each other.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/39.gif"><p>
Each of these planets is raising tides on the other one.  People
usually understand why there is a tidal bulge on the side facing
the other planet.  What they don't understand so easily is why
there's a bulge on the other side of the planet.  But it makes
sense when you consider that the other planet is not only pulling
the near bulge away from the center of the planet, but it's also
pulling the center of the planet away from the far bulge.
<p>
This is a really good picture of the relationship of the free
software community with the commercial software community.  We
might even label some of the extremes.  Let's just make up some
names.  We could call the left extreme, um, "Richard".
<p>
And we could call the right extreme something like, oh, "Bill".
<p>
The middle bulges are a little harder to name, but just for today
we can call this one on the middle left, "Larry", and that one on
the middle right, "Tim".  But of course, you can supply your own
names, since I just picked these names at random.
<p>
This is, of course, another oversimplification, because various
people and organizations aren't at a single spot in the diagram,
but tend to rattle around.  Some people manage to oscillate back
and forth from one bulge to the other.  One moment they're in
favor of more cooperation between the freeware and commercial
communities, and the next moment they're vilifying anything
commercial.  At least our hypothetical Richard and Bill are
consistent.
<p>
But the action is in the middle. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/40.gif"><p>
That's where everybody's been looking, to see what's going to
happen.  In fact, this is really last year's picture.  This year
it looks more like this.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/41.gif"><p>
Robert L. Forward has written a book, actually a series of books,
about a place called Rocheworld.  It's named after a fellow named
Roche, surprise, surprise.  He's the fellow that defined Roche's
limit, which predicted that planets would break up if they got
too close to each other.  It turns out he oversimplified because
his math wasn't powerful enough.  If you allow your planets to
deform into shapes like these, you can get them very much closer
together, and keep them stable.  Mind you, the net gravitational
pull on these points is very low, but it's enough to keep the
planets together.
<p>
In similar fashion, the freeware and commercial communities are
much closer together this year than many people thought possible
by the old calculations.  In Rocheworld, the planets did not
touch, but they shared atmospheres.  If we fuzz things out a
little with the magic of xpaint, then we kind of get the
picture. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/42.gif"><p>
You see how you can fly from one planet to the other, but not
walk.  It's reminscent of quantum mechanical tunneling, where you
can't get from here to there but you do it anyway with a flying
leap.
<p>
What we have flowing between the freeware and commercial
communities is a lot of ideas.  Together, these two inner lobes
define what we're now calling the Open Source movement.  What we
have here is something brand new: former enemies agreeing on a
common good that transcends any particular business model.  And
that common good is better software sooner.  Most of you have
probably read the Cathedral and the Bazaar by now.  So maybe I'm
preaching to the choir here.  But I thought you'd like the
picture.
<p>
Speaking of pictures, you know this also looks like a pair of
bacteria conjugating.  You realize that if the Internet had been
founded by bacteria, this would be considered pornographic
material.  I'm not sure why my talk keeps coming back to the
subject of sex, but in actual fact, that interchange of useful
information is the sort of relationship we're discussing here,
regardless of how you label the picture.  This is just plain sexy
stuff.
<p>
On a more practical note, I will show you what made it all
possible.  People realized the power of a simple idea.  We don't
need software patents or trade secrets.  All we need another
simple circle.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/43.gif"><p>
A circle with a 'c' in it.  Open Source lives or dies on
copyright law.  Our fond hope is that it lives.  Please, let's
all do our part to keep it that way.  If you have a chance to
plug copyrights over patents, please do so.  I know many of you
are already plugging copyrights over trade secrets.  Let's also
uphold copyright law by respecting the wishes of copyright
holders, whether or not they are spelled out to the satisfaction
of everyone's lawyer.  The 'c' in the circle should stand for
civility.
<p>
When we think of civility, we think of cities, and of doing
things fair and square.  So here's the requisite square. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/44.gif"><p>
And indeed, cities are built on squares, and rectangles.  We call
them blocks.  And if the city planners leave the buildings off of
a block, we call it a square.  Even if it isn't square.  Go
figure.
<p>
Sometimes the buildings themselves are square. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/45.gif"><p>
But often they're not.  Similarly, if you look through the
Unicode book, there are not nearly so many squares as there are
circles.  I think there's a fundamental underlying reason for
that.  When we build buildings, and when we write characters, we
install them into a rectilinear framework.  In terms of writing,
we write left-to-right, or right-to-left, or top-to-bottom.  The
abstract cells into which we install the characters or buildings
are squarish.  But both buildings and characters tend to
disappear visually if they follow the same lines as the overall
text.  So most characters tend to contain lines at odd angles,
just as many modern skyscrapers are designed to avoid looking
like boxes.  Nobody really likes the skyscrapers of the 1960's,
because they're too boxy.  People like things to be visually
distinct from their surroundings.
<p>
That is also why the various classes of operators and variables
in Perl are visually distinct from each other.  It's just sound
human engineering, as far as I'm concerned.  I don't like the
fact that all the operators look the same in Lisp.  I don't like
the fact that most the street signs look alike in Europe.  And I
applaud the decision of Germany to make their stop signs look
different from all the other signs.  Of course, it's also helpful
to us ignorant Americans that they made them look like American
stop signs.  Chalk up another one for cultural imperialism.
<p>
However, in repentence for American cultural imperialism, let me
tell you about another advantage of the ideographic system of
writing.  Because ideographs are written into square cells, they
can just as easily be written horizontally as vertically.  Or
vice versa.  Our variable-width characters do not have that nice
property.  Especially in a font like Helvetica, where you have
trouble telling i's and l's apart even when they're next to each
other.  Put one above the other and it'd just look like a dotted
line.  Chalk one up for the Chinese, the Japanese, and the
Koreans.
<p>
To wrap up, I'd like to talk about triangles.  Here's a sample.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/46.gif">
<p>
Triangles are related to circles in the same way that arrowheads
are related to targets. Here's a target.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/47.gif"><p>
I know I got this one right.  I looked it up on the Web.  More
importantly, I stopped as soon as I found the first one.
<p>
Actually, this is the Unicode character named "bullseye".
<P><img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/48.gif"><p>
I'm not quite sure what it's supposed to mean.  But that's never
stopped me before.  I'll make it mean something.
<p>
I've shot a lot of arrows in this talk, and I don't know whether
I've hit any bullseyes yet.  We put triangles on the front of
arrows because they're sharp.  Triangles are associated with
pain, especially if you step on one.  The angles of the triangle
tend to suggest the hard work of climbing a mountain. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/49.gif"><p>
On the other hand, looks can be deceiving.  A triangle also
represents a flat road stretching to the horizon. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/50.gif"><p>
It's all a matter of perspective.  You can choose your view by
choosing where to stand.  I can't predict whether Perl's road
ahead will be bumpy or smooth, but I can predict that the more
perspectives we can see things from, the easier it will be to
choose the perspectives we like.  And this is, after all, the job
of a language designer, to survey the problem from many
perspectives, to be just a little bit omniscient, so that other
people can benefit.  I do a little triangulation, and I map the
territory.  That's my job.  If my map gets you where you're
going, I'm happy.
<p>
If you take a section out of the Perl onion, it looks kind of
like a triangle.  Put in on its side and you have a growth chart
for Perl over the last ten years.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/51.gif"><p>
All fine and dandy.  This chart is notional, of course.  I have
no way of measuring Perl's actual growth.  But obviously it is
still growing.  We're doing a lot of things right, and by and
large we should keep doing just what we're doing.
<p>
Now suppose we shrink this triangle and extend the chart to show
the whole lifetime of Perl.  We really don't know how long it
might last.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/52.gif"><p>
It's hard to say what will make the difference here.  But I have
to tell you that I don't evaluate the success of Perl in terms of
how many people like me.  When I integrate these curves, I count
the number of people I've helped get their job done.
<p>
I can tell you that I think the difference between the red curve
and the yellow curve might depend on adding in all the potential
Windows users, and all the problems they need to solve.  Which
are many.  It's no accident that we've just put out a Win32 Perl
Resource Kit.
<p>
And I can tell you that the difference between the yellow curve
and the green curve may depend on adding in all the international
users that could benefit from Perl.  It's no accident that the
latest development version of Perl lets you name your variables
with any characters that are considered to be alphanumeric in
Unicode.  That includes ideographs.  There are a billion people
in China.  And I want them to be able to pass notes to each other
written in Perl.  I want them to be able to write poetry in
Perl.
<p>
That is my vision of the future.  My chosen perspective.
<p>
Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There
are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/53.gif"><p>
These are virtues of passion.  They are not, however, virtues of
community.  The virtues of community sound like their opposites:
diligence, patience, and humility. 
<P>
<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/54.gif"><p>
They're not really opposites, because you can do them all at
the same time.  It's another matter of perspective.  These are
the virtues that have brought us this far.  These are the
virtues that will carry our community into the future, if we do
not abandon them.
<p>
Basically, we just have to stay the course.  Friedrich Nietzsche
called it "a long obedience in the same direction", which is a
good snappy slogan.  But I like the full quote too:
<blockquote>
The essential thing "in heaven and earth" is ... that there
should be long obedience in the same direction; there thereby
results, and has always resulted in the long run, something
which has made life worth living.
</blockquote>
And now we've come full circle, back to the circle.  Here is the
front door of Bilbo Baggins' house.  There's a road that goes
from that door, and Bilbo wrote a poem about it. 
<P>

<img src="/1998/08/show/graphics/55.gif"><p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
The Road goes ever on and on,
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then?  I cannot say.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thank you all for sharing the Road with me.
