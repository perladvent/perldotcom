<p>
I've found the experiences of dancing and programming to have a great
deal in common.  With both I am immersed in an abstract world of
animated structures, building up and breaking down many times before
finally reaching a conclusion.  Indeed, when the operation of even the
dullest data-munging computer program is visualized, for example in a
debugger, it does seem to be dancing around its loops and conditions --
moving in patterns through time.</p>
<p>
In other words, a musical score is a kind of source code, and a
musical performance is a kind of running program.  When you play from
a musical score or run a program you are bringing instructions to
life.</p>
<p>
So a piece of composed music is like a Perl script, but let's not
forget improvised music.  The rules behind improvised music -- for
example improvised jazz -- develop during a performance, perhaps with
little or no predefined plan.  Where is the comparison with code here?
Well, how many times have you sat down to write some Perl without
first deciding exactly how you were going to structure it?  Perl is
great for improvising.  The question is, can you write improvised Perl
scripts on stage?  This article hopes to answer this question.</p>


<h3>Consumer Software v. Live Programming</h3>

<p>
If music and software have so much in common, how do they commonly
meet?  Well, modern-day music is often composed not at a piano but at
a computer.  Here the limits of composition are defined by the
creators of software, with musicians eagerly waiting for the next upgrade
of their favorite music application.  However, at the fringes of
electronic music, you find musicians who are also programmers, writing
their own software to generate their music.  This is a diverse world,
spanning and mixing all the genres you could think of, from classical
cantata form to speed garage to dance hall.  Very few of these
musicians have chosen Perl to write their musical code, but this
article hopes to encourage more Perl hackers to turn their tools to
music.</p>
<p>
A little about myself -- I'm a musician who for the last few years has
used Perl as my only musical instrument.  I've had some successes,
with hundreds of people dancing to my Perl, jumping about to my
subroutines, whooping as I started up a new script.  To this end, I
built a whole library of little compositional Perl scripts that I ran
together to make music.  However, when running my Perl scripts during
a performance I grew to feel as if I wasn't really performing -- I was
running software I'd written earlier, so to some extent the
performance was pre-prepared.  I could tweak parameters and so on, but
the underlying structure was dictated by my software.  So what's the
alternative?</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of months, I've moved toward writing software
live, in front of an audience.  If a programmer is onstage,
then they should program!  This may seem a little extreme, but I'm not
the only one making music this way.  This approach grew through a
collaboration with Adrian Ward called "slub," and also from a
fast-growing organization called TOPLAP, the Temporary Organisation
for the Promotion of Live Algorithm Programming.  Check
<a href="http://toplap.org/">http://toplap.org/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
I'll introduce my live-programming environment -- "feedback.pl" --later.
First, I'll talk a little about writing code that generates music.</p>


<h3>Generative Music in Practice</h3>

<p>
When I use the phrase Perl Music, I mean music that is generated live
by Perl code.  Instead of writing a melodic sequence by hand, a Perl
Musician writes a Perl script that algorithmically generates a melody.
When making music in this way, the composer is taking a step back from
the music, working with the structure behind a composition rather than
with the composition itself.  This approach is often termed
"Generative music."</p>
<p>
Perl hackers know that programming is a creative endeavour.  So
instead of starting with someone else's software, why not start with
nothing apart from some vague musical idea?  Then sit down and start
to express that idea as code.</p>
<p>
Now, while musical Perl code doesn't have to be complicated, it
doesn't have to make sense either, you don't have to plan on making
anything that is at all readable the next day.  Saying that, to take
full advantage of any inspiration you have found, code needs to be
written very quickly, so keen programming skills and good knowledge of
Perl is of great advantage.</p>
<p>
In any case, the most important thing is that your code makes a
musical pattern that you judge to be good.  Sometimes elegant
mathematical forms sound good, other times unexpected bugs and chaotic
nonsense produce the most interesting results.</p>
<p>
Let's sidetrack to talk a little about how you might build an
environment to make live Perl music, starting with a brief tour
around some useful CPAN modules.</p>


<h3>CPAN Music Modules</h3>

<p>
Sadly Perl isn't quite fast enough to be useful for synthesizing
sounds directly.  Instead we have to use Perl to trigger sounds by
talking to other bits of software or hardware.</p>
<p>
There are a fair few music related Perl modules to be found on CPAN,
perhaps the best known being the MIDI-Perl package by Sean Burke.
MIDI-Perl concerns itself only with the reading and writing of MIDI
files, which are a kind of musical score - this article is concerned
with making live music, not writing scores.  However, if you do want
to create or manipulate MIDI files, the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MIDI::Simple"><code>MIDI::Simple</code></a> module in the
MIDI-Perl package is a great place to start.</p>
<p>
As well as a file format for storing musical scores, MIDI also
provides a real time protocol for triggering sounds on synthesizers
and samplers in real time.  If you have a MIDI compatible synthesizer
or sampler then there are CPAN modules to help you take advantage of
them; <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MIDI::Music"><code>MIDI::Music</code></a> for UNIX and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Win32API::MIDI"><code>Win32API::MIDI</code></a> for Windows.</p>
<p>
Software synthesizers are now commonplace and reliable, thanks to the
increasing speed of computers and improving latency times of operating
systems including the Linux kernel.  Most music software is still
controllable by MIDI, but for a faster and more modern alternative,
have a look at Open Sound Control (OSC).</p>
<p>
OSC is an open network protocol for music, and is well supported by
the best free software music applications including pure-data,
SuperCollider and CSound.  It's most commonly carried over UDP, so you
can use your existing TCP/IP network and Internet connection for OSC.</p>
<p>
For sending and receiving OSC messages with Perl, install the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::OSC"><code>Audio::OSC</code></a> package from CPAN.  Here's an example of its use:</p>
<pre><code>
  my $osc = 
      Audio::OSC::Client-&gt;new(Host =&gt; 'localhost', Port =&gt; 57120);
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
  $osc-&gt;send(['#bundle', time() + 0.25, ['/play', 'i', "60"]]);
</code></pre>
<p>
This example sends a message to port 57120 telling it to play number
60 in a quarter of a second's time.  The OSC protocol doesn't define
the meaning of such commands, it's up to you to make sure that the
receiving application understands what the sending application is
asking of it.  Later I'll show the use of <code>Audio::OSC</code> to talk to an
application called SuperCollider.</p>
<p>
Ecasound is an excellent piece of software useful for live routing and
recording of audio.  It supports LADSPA plug-ins, allowing you full
programmatic control over a wide range of effects such as noise
filters, reverb, chorus and so on.  For full real time control over
ecasound, install the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::Ecasound"><code>Audio::Ecasound</code></a> module.</p>
<p>
While not likely to have a place in a professional studio, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::Beep"><code>Audio::Beep</code></a>
is a fun way of making primitive, monophonic music.  I'll use this in
an example later.</p>
<p>
Finally, perhaps the most essential CPAN module for live music is
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Time::HiRes"><code>Time::HiRes</code></a>.  Unless your music is very intense, at some point you'll
want your script to pause before triggering the next sound.  Normally
Perl only lets you sleep for whole seconds at a time, but <code>Time::HiRes</code>
offers a great deal more accuracy.  Time is such an important issue in
music, that I've dedicated the whole of the next section to it.</p>


<h3>Time</h3>

<p>
Time is central to music, and presents a few technical hurdles to
jump.  If you have more than one music-generating Perl script running
at the same time, you'll want to keep them in sync somehow, and if
you're playing with someone else, you'll need to keep in sync with
them as well.  You not only need to make sure all the different
scripts are playing at the same speed, but also in phase - that is,
everything needs to be able to work out when the start of the bar is.
Further, at some point you'll want to change the speed of the music,
especially if your crowd are looking a bit restless. And if you want
to start up a new script while another is running, how do get it to
start at the right moment?</p>
<p>
Here's how I do it, in brief.  I have a central time server called
'tm.pl', that stores the current bangs per minute (bpm), the number of bangs
that have occurred since the script started, the number of bangs since
the last bpm tempo change and the time of that change.  It keeps this
information up to date by referring to the system clock.  By fetching
these four simple bits of information it's possible for another Perl
script to work out what it should be doing and when.</p>
<p>
A 'bang' is like a musical beat, or the regular tick of a clock.  Each
Perl script keeps its own 'heart beat', an event that regularly calls
a method called 'bang'.  I put all my music generating code inside
that 'bang' method.  If it receives a bpm change from the server it
schedules the change of speed at exactly the right moment.</p>
<p>
Well, I say that but of course computers are volatile things, and so
in practice events never happen at exactly the right moment.  But as
long as the math is right, any slight error is corrected, and so the
scripts stay in synchrony.</p>













<h3>Introducing <code>feedback.pl</code></h3>

<p>
Now as I tried to explain earlier, I like to write code live while
practicing and performing.  I should really explain what this means.</p>
<p>
I wrote my own little text editor for live coding.  The editor is only
intended for writing Perl code, but doesn't have a save function.  In
that case, you might wonder how I execute the code.  </p>
<p>
Well if you're using feedback.pl, the code you're writing is running
all the time, in the background.  In fact feedback.pl has two
"threads" - one thread is the text editor and another runs the code
that is being edited.  The running code in the second thread re-parses
itself whenever you press ctrl-x, leaving all variables intact.
mod_perl programmers will be familiar with this concept -- the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::StatINC"><code>Apache::StatINC</code></a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::Reload"><code>Apache::Reload</code></a> modules do something very similar.</p>
<p>
It gets weirder -- the running code can edit its own source code.  This
is really useful for user feedback.  I quite often write code that
puts comments in its source that tells me what the running code is up
to.  So, the human interface to the running code is its source code.
You edit the code to modify the process; the process edits the code in
response.  That's why it's called <code>feedback.pl</code>.</p>
<p>
If you want to see what I mean, download <code>feedback.pl</code> from:</p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/feedback-0.1.pl">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/feedback-0.1.pl</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll need a few modules installed from CPAN to get it to work.
<code>Audio::Beep</code>, <code>Audio::OSC</code> and <code>Time::HiRes</code>.  Sadly <code>Audio::Beep</code> only works
under Linux and Microsoft Windows at the moment, users of other
operating systems will have to fiddle about to get these examples to
work.</p>
<p>
Once everything is ready, run <code>feedback.pl</code> and type this little script in:</p>
<pre><code>
  # 231
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      $self-&gt;code-&gt;[0] = '# ' . $self-&gt;{bangs};
      $self-&gt;modified;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Press ctrl-x and it will start to run.  <code>$self-&gt;{bangs} </code> contains the
number of bangs since the script was started, and this is written to
the first line of the code (make sure that line doesn't have anything
important in it).  Calling <code>$self-&gt;modified</code> tells the editor that the
code has changed, causing it to refresh the screen with the changes.</p>
<p>
OK, lets make some sounds.</p>

<pre><code>
  #
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      my $note = 100;
      $note += 50 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 4 == 0;  
      $note -= 30 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 3 == 0;  
      $note += 60 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 7 == 0;
      beep($note, 40);
      $self-&gt;code-&gt;[0] = '# note: ' . $note;
      $self-&gt;modified;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Hopefully this should play a bassline through your speaker.  <code>beep()</code> is a routine imported from <code>Audio::Beep</code>; you just pass it a frequency
in Hz and a duration in milliseconds.</p>
<p>
The bassline is surprisingly complex for such a short program. It
could almost be the theme tune to an 8-bit computer game.  The
complexity comes from the use of polyrhythms, in this case three
different modulus combined together.  </p>
<p>
Polyrhythms are wonderful to play with but largely absent from
commercial dance music.  You can see one reason for this absence by looking at
consumer music software -- while such pieces of software are obsessed
with loops, they don't make it very easy for you to mix loops with
different time signatures together.  Writing our own code brings us
freedom from such constraints, and you can really hear that freedom in
polyrhythms.</p>
<p>
Now these simple beeps are fun, but quite limited, obviously.  You can
only play one beep at a time, and have no control over the timbral
qualities of the sound.  Lets have a quick look at getting better
sounds out of our computers by controlling SuperCollider from Perl.</p>


<h3>Beyond the Beep -- SuperCollider</h3>

<p>
SuperCollider is a powerful language for audio synthesis, is free
Software, and runs under both Linux and Mac OS X.  It consists of two
Parts: <code>scserver</code>, a real-time sound synthesis server, and <code>sclang</code>, an
Object-Oriented interpreted language based on smalltalk (sclang).  Due
to SuperCollider's client-server architecture, it's possible for other
languages to replace sclang and control scserver directly, although
scheme is the only other language with the libraries for this so far.
However, with Perl it's easy to control sclang scripts with the
aforementioned <code>Audio::OSC</code> module.</p>
<p>
As a rich programming language, SuperCollider takes a bit of learning; however, if you want to try making some sounds with Perl and
SuperCollider script.  Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/simple.sc">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/simple.sc</a></p>

<p>
Once you have SuperCollider running, you can start up the script like
so:</p>

<pre><code>
  sclang ./simple.sc -
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that SuperCollider users call their programs "patches" rather
than "scripts".  Patching (or paching) is a historical term that
originally referred to the programming of analog synthesizers, but as
far as SuperCollider is concerned, it's mostly synonymous with
scripting.</p>
<p>
The simple.sc script listens for OSC messages, which you can send from
feedback.pl using the built in methods 'play' and 'trigger' like this:</p>

<pre><code>
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      # play a "middle c" note every fourth bang
      $self-&gt;play({num =&gt; 60})
        if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 4 == 0;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also trigger a sample in this way:</p>

<pre><code>
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      # play a drum sample for 100 milliseconds, panned slightly to the left,
      # every sixth bang
      $self-&gt;trigger({sample =&gt; '/home/alex/samples/drum.wav'
                      ts     =&gt; 100,
                      pan    =&gt; 0.4
                     }
                    )
        if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 6 == 0;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the source code of feedback.pl to see how the OSC message is
sent, and to seek out extra parameters to effect the sound further.</p>


<h3>Multiple Scripts</h3>

<p>
To have multiple scripts running at the same time, you can use my
"tm.pl" script.  </p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/tm-0.1.pl">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/tm-0.1.pl</a>
</p>

<p>
It requires a spread communication daemon (<a href="http://spread.org/">http://spread.org/</a>) to be
running and the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Spread::Session"><code>Spread::Session</code></a> Perl module to be installed.  Start
the tm.pl script, set the environment variable SPREAD to 1, and then
multiple invocations of feedback.pl will stay in synch.  You can
change the bpm (bangs per minute, similar to beats per minute) at any
time, for example $self-&gt;set_bpm(800) will set the bpm to 800, which
is suitable for fast gabba techno.</p>


<h3>Further Experiments</h3>

<p>
I haven't gone into detail about how to generate the music itself -
that's really up to you and your imagination.  However, here are a few
pointers toward some interesting areas of research.</p>
<p>
Markov chains are a way of probabilistically analyzing a
one-dimensional structure and then generating new structures based on
the original.  It's used often for producing amusingly garbled text,
but can also be used for making amusingly garbled music.  Check
Richard Clamp's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Algorithm::MarkovChain"><code>Algorithm::MarkovChain</code></a> module on CPAN for more details.</p>
<p>
Regular expressions are of course excellent for manipulating chunks of
text, but why not instead use them to manipulate sequences of notes
while they are playing?  Being able to hear as well as see the effect
of a regex is rather pleasing.</p>
<p>
Lastly, my best advice when looking for inspiration is to listen to
your favorite pieces of music.  Listen to the structure behind a
piece and think about how you might write an algorithm to create that
structure.  Once you start writing the code you'll start to get more
ideas based upon it, so that the eventual music sounds nothing like
what you found inspiration from.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This might all sound like a rather strange and tortured way of making
music, but actually the opposite is true.  It's not strange, there is
structure behind every piece of music, and it's quite normal for
composers to think of the composition of this structure in terms of a
defined process.  The classic example is of Mozart using dice to
generate tunes.  It's not tortured either.  Thanks to Perl, music
generating code can be extremely fast to work with.</p>
<p>
The aims of all this are many and varied.  One is to make people dance
to Perl code, another is to be able to jam freely with others, not
only laptop musicians but also drummers, singers and other 'real'
musicians.  Indeed, although programming does allow a certain unique
perspective on things, the overall aim is to be able to reach some
kind of level playing field with other musicians.  I believe to reach
this point, we have to learn how to use the whole computer as a
musical instrument, rather than limiting ourselves to consumer
software packages.  So give it a go with Perl.</p>
<h3>Footnote</h3>

<p>
At the time of writing and due to active development, <code>Audio::OSC</code> is
not currently passing tests under Linux and quite possibly other
architectures.  It'll be fixed soon but until then users can <a href="http://yaxu.org/audio-osc.patch-yaxu">find a patch</a> that allows        
it to work under Intel-based Linux.  To be truthful, all of this                
software is heavily experimental, feel free to <a
