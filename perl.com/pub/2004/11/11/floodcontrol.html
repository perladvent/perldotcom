                                        <p>Accordingly to Merriam-Webster Online, "flood" means:</p>

<blockquote><p>1: a rising and overflowing of a body of water especially onto
normally dry land;</p>

<p>2: an overwhelming quantity or volume.</p></blockquote>

<p>In computer software there are very similar situations when an unpredictable
and irregular flow of events can reach higher levels. Such situations usually
are not comfortable for users, either slowing down systems or having other undesired
effects.</p>

<p>Floods can occur from accessing web pages, requesting information from
various sources (ftp lists, irc services, etc.), receiving SMS notification
messages, and email processing. It is obvious that it is not possible to list
all flood cases.</p>

<p>"Flood control" is a method of controlling the processing-rate of a stream of
events. It can reject or postpone events until there are available resources (CPU, time, space, etc.) for them.  Essentially the flood control restricts the
number of events processed in a specific period of time.</p>

<h3><a id="closing_the_gates">Closing the Gates</a></h3>

<p>To maintain flood control, you must calculate the flood ratio, which is:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2004/11/11/graphics/flood2-eq1.gif" width="73" height="50" alt="flood ratio equation" /><br /><em>Figure 1.
Flood ratio equation.</em></p>

<pre><code><em>fr</em> flood ratio
<em>ec</em> event count
<em>tp</em> time period for ec</code></pre>

<p>To determine if a flood is occurring, compare the flood ratio to the fixed
maximum (threshold) ratio. If the result is less than the threshold, there's no
flood.  Accept the event.  If the result is higher, refuse or postpone the
event.</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2004/11/11/graphics/flood2-eq2.gif" width="68" height="50" alt="comparing the ratios" /><br /><em>Figure 2.
Comparing the ratios.</em></p>

<pre><code><em>ec</em> event count
<em>tp</em> time period for ec
<em>fc</em> fixed event count (max)
<em>fp</em> fixed time period for fc</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to keep an array of timestamps of all events. Upon receipt of
a new event, calculate the time period since the oldest event to use as the
current count/time ratio. This approach has two drawbacks.  The first is that
it uses more and more memory to hold all of the timestamps.  Suppose that you
want only two events to happen inside a one-minute period, giving two events
per minute.  Someone can trigger a single event, wait half an hour, and finally
flood you with another 58 requests. At this point the ratio will be 1.9/min.,
well below the 2/min. limit.  This is the second drawback.</p>

<p>A better approach is to keep a sliding window either of events
(<code>fc</code>) or time period (<code>fp</code>).</p>

<p>This period window requires an array of the last events. This array size is
unknown. (The specific time units are not important, but the following examples
use minutes.)</p>

<pre><code>
               past                                   now
    Timeline:  1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8----9---&gt; (min)
    Events:    e1      e2 e3         e4     e5 e6     e7</code></pre>

<p>This timeline measures event timestamps.  To calculate the flood ratio,
you count events newer than the current time window of size <code>fp</code>. And check against a ratio of four events in three minutes:</p>

<pre><code>Time now:      9
Time window:   from 9-3 = 6 to now(9), so window is 6-9
Oldest event:  e5 (not before 6)
Event count:   3 (in 6-9 period)
Flood ratio:   3/3</code></pre>

<p>This ratio of 3/3 is below the flood threshold of 4/3, so at this moment
there is no flood.  Perform this check at the last event to check.  In this
example, this event is <code>e7</code>. After each check, you can safely remove
all events older than the time window to reduce memory consumption.</p>

<p>The other solution requires a fixed array of events with size <code>fc</code>.
With our 4ev/3min example, then:</p>

<pre><code>
               past                  now
    Timeline:  &lt;--5----6----7----8----9---&gt; (min)
    Events:      e4        e5 e6     e7</code></pre>

<p>The event array (window) is size 4. To check for a flood at
<code>e7</code>, we use this:</p>

<pre><code>Window size "fc": 4
First event time: e4 -&gt; 5
Last  event time: e7 -&gt; 9
Time period "tp": 9-5 = 4
Flood ratio is:   4/4</code></pre>

<p>The ratio of 4/4 is also below the threshold of 4/3, so it's OK to accept
event <code>e7</code>.  When you must check a new event, add it to the end
of the event array (window) and remove the oldest one.  If the new event would
cause a flood, remember to reverse these operations.</p>

<p>If the flood check fails, you can find a point in the future when this check
will be OK.  This makes it possible to return some feedback information to the
user indicating how much time to wait before the system will accept the next
event:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2004/11/11/graphics/flood2-eq3.gif" width="126" height="50" alt="time until next event equation" /><br
/><em>Figure 3.  Time until next event equation.</em></p>

<pre><code><em>ec</em>  event count (requests received, here equal to fc)
<em>fc</em>  fixed event count (max)
<em>fp</em>  fixed time period for fc
<em>now</em> the future time point we search for
<em>ot</em>  oldest event time point in the array (event timestamp)</code></pre>
    
<p><img src="/pub/2004/11/11/graphics/flood2-eq4.gif" width="186" height="50" alt="simplified time until next event equation"
/><br /><em>Figure 4.  Simplified time until next event equation.</em></p>

<p><img src="/pub/2004/11/11/graphics/flood2-eq5.gif" width="192" height="30" alt="time to wait equation" /><br
/><em>Figure 5.  The time-to-wait equation.</em></p>

<pre><code><em>time</em> the actual current time (time of the new event)
<em>wait</em> time period to wait before next allowed event</code></pre>

<p>If <code>wait</code> is positive, then this event should be either rejected
or postponed. When <code>wait</code> is 0 or negative, it's OK to process the
event immediately.</p>

<h3><a id="the_code">The Code</a></h3>

<p>In the following implementation I'll use a slightly modified version of the
sliding window of events.  To avoid removing the last event and eventually
replacing it after a failed check, I decided to check the current flood ratio with
the existing events array and with the time of the new one:</p>

<pre><code>
               past                  now
    Timeline:  &lt;--5----6----7----8----9---&gt; (min)
    Events:      e3   e4   e5 e6    (e7)

    Window size <em>fc</em>: 4 (without e7)
    First event time: e4 -&gt; 5
    Last event time: e7 -&gt; 9
    Time period <em>tp</em>: 9-5 = 4
    Flood ratio is:   4/4</code></pre>

<p>This seems a bit strange at first, but it works exactly as needed. The check
is performed as if <code>e6</code> is timed as <code>e7</code>, which is the
worst case (the biggest time period for the fixed event window size). If the
check passes, than after removing <code>e3</code>, the flood ratio will be
always below the threshold!</p>

<p>Following this description I wrote a function to call for each request or
event that needs flood control. It receives a fixed, maximum count of requests
(the events window size) and a fixed time period. It returns how much time must
elapse until the next allowed event, or 0 if it's OK to process the event
immediately.</p>

<p>This function should be generic, so it needs some kind of event names. To
achieve this there is a third argument -- the specific event name for each
flood check.</p>

<p>Here is the actual code:</p>

<pre><code># this package hash holds flood arrays for each event name
# hash with flood keys, this is the internal flood check data storage
our %FLOOD;

sub flood_check
{
  my $fc = shift; # max flood events count
  my $fp = shift; # max flood time period for $fc events
  my $en = shift; # event name (key) which identifies flood check data

  $FLOOD{ $en } ||= [];   # make empty flood array for this event name
  my $ar = $FLOOD{ $en }; # get array ref for event's flood array
  my $ec = @$ar;          # events count in the flood array
  
  if( $ec &gt;= $fc ) 
    {
    # flood array has enough events to do real flood check
    my $ot = $$ar[0];      # oldest event timestamp in the flood array
    my $tp = time() - $ot; # time period between current and oldest event
    
    # now calculate time in seconds until next allowed event
    my $wait = int( ( $ot + ( $ec * $fp / $fc ) ) - time() );
    if( $wait &gt; 0 )
      {
      # positive number of seconds means flood in progress
      # event should be rejected or postponed
      return $wait;
      }
    # negative or 0 seconds means that event should be accepted
    # oldest event is removed from the flood array
    shift @$ar;
    }
  # flood array is not full or oldest event is already removed
  # so current event has to be added
  push  @$ar, time();
  # event is ok
  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>I've put this on the CPAN as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Algorithm-FloodControl">Algorithm::FloodControl</a>.</p>

<p>To test it, I wrote a simple program that accepts text, line by line, from
standard input and prints each accepted line or the amount of time before the
program will accept the next line.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use Algorithm::FloodControl;

while(&lt;&gt;)
  {
  # time is used to illustrate the results
  my $tm = scalar localtime;
  
  # exit on `quit' or `exit' strings
  exit if /exit|quit/i;
  
  # FLOOD CHECK: allow no more than 2 same lines in 10 seconds
  # here I use the actual data for flood event name!
  my $lw = flood_check( 2, 10, $_ );
  
  if( $lw ) # local wait time
    {
    chomp;
    print "WARNING: next event allowed in $lw seconds (LOCAL CHECK for '$_')\n";
    next;
    }
  print "$tm: LOCAL  OK: $_";
  
  # FLOOD CHECK: allow no more than 5 lines in 60 seconds
  my $gw = flood_check( 5, 60, 'GLOBAL' );
  
  if( $gw ) # global wait time
    {
    print "WARNING: next event allowed in $gw seconds (GLOBAL CHECK)\n";
    next;
    }
  print "$tm: GLOBAL OK: $_";
  }</code></pre>

<p>I named this <code>floodtest.pl</code>.  The  of the test were: ("&gt;"
marks my input lines)</p>

<pre><code>cade@aenea:~$ ./floodtest.pl

<p>You can see that I could not enter "hello" 3 times during the first 10
seconds but still I managed to enter one more "hello" a bit later (the 10-second flood had ended for the "hello" line) and 2 other lines before the
global flood check triggered (5 lines for 1 minute).  After 60 seconds,
<em>floodtest.pl</em> finally accepted my sixth line, "free again."</p>

<p>The next sections show how to use flood control in several applications.
These examples are not exhaustive but are very common, so they will work as
templates for other cases.</p>

<h3><a id="my_scores_please">My Scores Please?</a></h3>

<p>Imagine an IRC bot (robot) which can report scores from the local game servers. Generally this bot receives requests from someone inside IRC channel
(a chat room, for those of you who haven�t used IRC) and reports current
scores back to the channel. If this eventually becomes very popular, people
will start requesting scores more frequently than it is useful just for fun, so
there's a clear need for flood control.</p>

<p>I'd prefer to allow any user to request scores no more than twice per minute,
but at the same time I want to allow 10 requests total every two minutes:</p>

<pre><code>sub scores_request
{
    my $irc     = shift; # the IRC connection which I communicate over
                         # this is a Net::IRC::Connection object
    my $channel = shift; # the channel where "scores" are requested
    my $user    = shift; # the user who requested scores

    # next line means: do flood check for $user and if it is ok, then
    #                  check for global flood. this is usual Perl idiom.
    my $wait = flood_check( 2, 60, $user ) || flood_check( 10, 120, '*' );
    if( $wait ) # can be 0 or positive number so this check is simple
      {
      # oops flood detected, report this personally to the user
      $irc-&gt;notice( $user, "please wait $wait seconds" );
      }
    else
      {
      # it is ok, there is no flood, print scores back to the channel
      $irc-&gt;privmsg( $channel, get_scores() );
      }
}</code></pre>

<p>This code uses the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-IRC">Net::IRC</a> module, so if you want
to know the details of the <code>notice()</code> and <code>privmsg()</code>
functions, check the module documentation.</p>

<p>This is good example of combining events, but it works correctly only if the
second flood ratio (in this case 10/120) is greater than first one (2/60).
Otherwise you should extend the <code>flood_check()</code> function with an
array of events to check in one loop, so if any of them fails the internal
storage will update. Perhaps <code>Algorithm::FloodControl</code> will have such a feature
in the future.</p>

<p>Another common case is to limit the execution of resource-consuming web
scripts (CGI).</p>

<h3><a id="_don_t__flood_the_page_">(Don't) Flood the Page!</a></h3>

<p>If you want to limit CGI-script execution you will hit a problem: you must
save and restore the flood-control internal data between script invocations.
For this reason the <code>Algorithm::FloodControl</code> module exports another function
called <code>flood_storage</code>, which can get or set the internal data.</p>

<p>In this example I'll use two other modules, <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Storable">Storable</a> and <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/LockFile-Simple">LockFile::Simple</a>.  I use
the first to save and restore the flood-control data to and from disk files and
the second to lock this file to avoid corruptions if two or more instances of
the script run at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use Storable qw( store retrieve );
use LockFile::Simple qw( lock unlock );
use Algorithm::FloodControl;

# this is the file that should keep the flood data though /tmp is not
# the perfect place for it
my $flood_file = "/tmp/flood-cgi.dat";

# this is required so the web browser will know what is expected
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";

# I wanted to limit the script executions per remote IP so I have to
# read it from the web server environment
my $remote_ip = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

# first of all--lock the flood file
lock( $flood_file );

# now read the flood data if flood file exists
my $FLOOD = retrieve( $flood_file ) if -r $flood_file;

# load flood data into the internal storage
flood_storage( $FLOOD ) if $FLOOD;

# do the actual flood check: max 5 times per minute for each IP
# this is the place where more checks can be done
my $wait = flood_check( 5, 60, "TEST_CGI:$remote_ip" );

# save hte internal data back to the disk
store( flood_storage(), $flood_file );

# and finally unlock the file
unlock( $flood_file );

if( $wait )
  {
  # report flood situation
  print "You have to wait $wait seconds before requesting this page again.\n";
  exit;
  }

# there is no flood, continue with the real work here
print "Hello, this is main script here, local time is:\n";
print scalar localtime;
print "\n...\n";</code></pre>

<p>There are various issues to consider, such as the save/restore method, time
required, and locking, but in any case the scheme will be similar.</p>

<h3><a id="beep__beep__beep___">Beep, Beep, Beep ...</a></h3>

<p>In this last example I'll describe a small program, a variation of which I
use for (email) SMS notifications. I wanted to avoid scanning large mail
directories so I made my email filter copy incoming messages into a
separate folder.  The program scans this copy folder every 10 minutes for new
messages. If there are any, it sends a notification for each one to my mobile
phone and removes the copy of the message.</p>

  # so I'll point just that it extracts subject line from the message file
  # and sends (over local sms gateway) text including folder name, time 
  # and subject
  unlink( $file );
  print "SMS: $folder, $file\n";
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this code -- while implementing a totally different task -- has
exactly the same flood check as in the previous two examples.</p>

<h3><a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>I said in the beginning that flood control has a vast field of applications.
There are many cases where it is appropriate or even necessary. There is no
excuse to avoid such checks; implementing it is not hard at all.</p>
